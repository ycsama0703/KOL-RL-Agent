#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en imagine a $574 paycheck hitting your account monthly passive consistent and scalable now what if I told you it's achievable using just six ETFs sounds crazy right but this isn't a Dream It's A system that works in this video I'll show you how I built a portfolio that pays $574 monthly why most people Overlook these opportunities and the exact steps you can take to replicate it if you want to skip the trial and error stick around to the in where I'll share how to FastTrack your results with my patreon if you want passive income you need consistency that means dividends hitting your account month after month regardless of what the Market's doing but here's the thing building that kind of income isn't about buying random stocks it's about leverage and the best leverage in the game dividend ETFs dividend ETFs take the guesswork out of income investing instead of you trying to pick the perfect companies these funds do the work for you selecting a curated basket high quality dividend paying stocks it's like having a team of analysts working around the clock to maximize your returns but not all dividend ETFs are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent results instead of managing a dozen moving Parts you focus on one thing choosing the right ETFs to build your portfolio with the Right Mix you can generate steady income without the stress of micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a top spot in your portfolio it's not just a dividend play it's a strategy for turning today's Tech giants into tomorrow's passive income Powerhouse now not all of your money should be chasing big plays smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only preserving my Capital but also growing it while keeping liquidity intact they're like a financial Pit Stop steady reliable and always ready to fuel the next leg of your portfolio's journey if you're not using cash parking funds you're absolutely leaving money on the table SNS and swvxx don't just keep your dry powder safe they they make sure it's earning until you're ready to make your next move in investing timing is everything and these funds keep you ready to win every portfolio needs a steady hand something you can rely on to perform even when the market goes Haywire that's SCD it's not flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you want to FASTT trck your results join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory it's a system I use to generate consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",jpq,0.95,0.9

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en imagine a $574 paycheck hitting your account monthly passive consistent and scalable now what if I told you it's achievable using just six ETFs sounds crazy right but this isn't a Dream It's A system that works in this video I'll show you how I built a portfolio that pays $574 monthly why most people Overlook these opportunities and the exact steps you can take to replicate it if you want to skip the trial and error stick around to the in where I'll share how to FastTrack your results with my patreon if you want passive income you need consistency that means dividends hitting your account month after month regardless of what the Market's doing but here's the thing building that kind of income isn't about buying random stocks it's about leverage and the best leverage in the game dividend ETFs dividend ETFs take the guesswork out of income investing instead of you trying to pick the perfect companies these funds do the work for you selecting a curated basket high quality dividend paying stocks it's like having a team of analysts working around the clock to maximize your returns but not all dividend ETFs are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent results instead of managing a dozen moving Parts you focus on one thing choosing the right ETFs to build your portfolio with the Right Mix you can generate steady income without the stress of micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a top spot in your portfolio it's not just a dividend play it's a strategy for turning today's Tech giants into tomorrow's passive income Powerhouse now not all of your money should be chasing big plays smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only preserving my Capital but also growing it while keeping liquidity intact they're like a financial Pit Stop steady reliable and always ready to fuel the next leg of your portfolio's journey if you're not using cash parking funds you're absolutely leaving money on the table SNS and swvxx don't just keep your dry powder safe they they make sure it's earning until you're ready to make your next move in investing timing is everything and these funds keep you ready to win every portfolio needs a steady hand something you can rely on to perform even when the market goes Haywire that's SCD it's not flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you want to FASTT trck your results join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory it's a system I use to generate consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",swvxx,0.9,0.8

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en imagine a $574 paycheck hitting your account monthly passive consistent and scalable now what if I told you it's achievable using just six ETFs sounds crazy right but this isn't a Dream It's A system that works in this video I'll show you how I built a portfolio that pays $574 monthly why most people Overlook these opportunities

income you need consistency that means dividends hitting your account month after month regardless of what the Market's doing but here's the thing building that kind of income isn't about buying random stocks it's about leverage and the best leverage in the game dividend ETFs dividend ETFs take the guesswork out of income investing instead of you trying to pick the perfect companies these funds do the work for you selecting a curated basket high quality dividend paying stocks it's like having a team of analysts working around the clock to maximize your returns but not all dividend ETFs are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent results instead of managing a dozen moving Parts you focus on one thing choosing the right ETFs to build your portfolio with the Right Mix you can generate steady income without the stress of micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a top spot in your portfolio it's not just a dividend play it's a strategy for turning today's Tech giants into tomorrow's passive income Powerhouse now not all of your money should be chasing big plays smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only preserving my Capital but also growing it while keeping liquidity intact they're like a financial Pit Stop steady reliable and always ready to fuel the next leg of your portfolio's journey if you're not using cash parking funds you're absolutely leaving money on the table SNS and swvxx don't just keep your dry powder safe they they make sure it's earning until you're ready to make your next move in investing timing is everything and these funds keep you ready to win every portfolio needs a steady hand something you can rely on to perform even when the market goes Haywire that's SCD it's not flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you want to FASTT trck your results join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory it's a system I use to generate consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",SMH,0.9,0.8

are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent

micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a

smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only

flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you

consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",triple Q,0.8,0.2

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en imagine a $574 paycheck hitting your account monthly passive consistent and scalable now what if I told you it's achievable using just six ETFs sounds crazy right but this isn't a Dream It's A system that works in this video I'll show you how I built a portfolio that pays $574 monthly why most people Overlook these opportunities

income you need consistency that means dividends hitting your account month after month regardless of what the Market's doing but here's the thing building that kind of income isn't about buying random stocks it's about leverage and the best leverage in the game dividend ETFs dividend ETFs take the guesswork out of income investing instead of you trying to pick the perfect companies these funds do the work for you selecting a curated basket high quality dividend paying stocks it's like having a team of analysts working around the clock to maximize your returns but not all dividend ETFs are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent results instead of managing a dozen moving Parts you focus on one thing choosing the right ETFs to build your portfolio with the Right Mix you can generate steady income without the stress of micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a top spot in your portfolio it's not just a dividend play it's a strategy for turning today's Tech giants into tomorrow's passive income Powerhouse now not all of your money should be chasing big plays smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only preserving my Capital but also growing it while keeping liquidity intact they're like a financial Pit Stop steady reliable and always ready to fuel the next leg of your portfolio's journey if you're not using cash parking funds you're absolutely leaving money on the table SNS and swvxx don't just keep your dry powder safe they they make sure it's earning until you're ready to make your next move in investing timing is everything and these funds keep you ready to win every portfolio needs a steady hand something you can rely on to perform even when the market goes Haywire that's SCD it's not flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you want to FASTT trck your results join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory it's a system I use to generate consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",Microsoft,0.95,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en imagine a $574 paycheck hitting your account monthly passive consistent and scalable now what if I told you it's achievable using just six ETFs sounds crazy right but this isn't a Dream It's A system that works in this video I'll show you how I built a portfolio that pays $574 monthly why most people Overlook these opportunities and the exact steps you can take to replicate it if you want to skip the trial and error stick around to the in where I'll share how to FastTrack your results with my patreon if you want passive income you need consistency that means dividends hitting your account month after month regardless of what the Market's doing but here's the thing building that kind of income isn't about buying random stocks it's about leverage and the best leverage in the game dividend ETFs dividend ETFs take the guesswork out of income investing instead of you trying to pick the perfect companies these funds do the work for you selecting a curated basket high quality dividend paying stocks it's like having a team of analysts working around the clock to maximize your returns but not all dividend ETFs are created equal some promise big yields but sacrifice long-term stability to deliver those payouts that's what we call a dividend trap the kind of fund that hands you cash on one side while losing value on the other the result you're getting paid but your overall portfolio shrinks the right dividend ETFs avoid this Pitfall they're built for stability and cash flow take jpq for example it's an ETF that capitalizes on the growth of the NASDAQ 100 while delivering a 10.1% yield paid monthly or a fund like SNS XX which earns 4.17% by parking cash in safe income generating assets These funds don't just pay you they protect your money while it grows this is why dividend ETFs are a GameChanger for passive income investors they're efficient Diversified and designed to deliver consistent results instead of managing a dozen moving Parts you focus on one thing choosing the right ETFs to build your portfolio with the Right Mix you can generate steady income without the stress of micromanaging every stock passive income isn't about complexity it's about strategy dividend ETFs are the simplest most effective way to create a portfolio that pays you consistently anything less is just unnecessary work when it comes to dividend income not all ETFs are created equal some trickle out small payments every quarter others they send cash straight to your account every month like clockwork inner JQ the Undisputed king of my dividend portfolio and here's why jpq isn't just another ETF with a 10.1% dividend yield it's a cash flow machine designed to take advantage of the NASDAQ 100 think of it as your ticket to Turning high growth tech stocks into steady monthly income in December alone jeq paid me 4,42 $26 that's almost 80% of my total passive income from Just One Fund here's how it works jpq uses a covered call strategy that means it holds the same Tech heavy stocks as the triple Q think Apple Microsoft and Amazon but sells options against them to generate extra income the result you get paid whether the Market's up down or sideways and because it only uses 20% of its portfolio for options it still captures Tech growth while protecting against major downturns but let's be real jeq isn't perfect if tech takes a hit jpq feels it too that's why you don't put all your money in One Fund but for aggressive income Seekers it's a no-brainer the combination of tech exposure and monthly payouts makes it an essential piece of any high yield strategy most dividend ETFs stick to quarterly payouts but jbq rewrites the rulebook with monthly income you don't just collect dividends you can reinvest them faster compounding your returns over time that's leverage and it's what sets jeq apart if you're serious about creating a reliable income stream JQ deserves a top spot in your portfolio it's not just a dividend play it's a strategy for turning today's Tech giants into tomorrow's passive income Powerhouse now not all of your money should be chasing big plays smart investors keep some of their portfolio in dry powder cash that's ready to deploy when the right opportunity hits but here's the problem cash sitting Idol does nothing that's why I use SNS xx and swvxx these funds keep my cash safe liquid and earning so I'm always ready to strike and here's what makes them bulletproof they both trade at $1 always that means there's no risk of losing your principal SNS XX with its 4.1% dividend yield paid me $954,000 in free money from cash I'm just holding and SWV same deal it delivers a 4.25% yield while staying completely liquid These funds ensure my dry powder is working while I wait for the next big move why is this so important because opportunities don't wait for you to sell stocks imagine the market tanks and the perfect ETF hits your buy Zone if you don't have cash ready you're either stuck or forced to sell something else often at the worst time with these two I always have dry powder ready to deploy without compromising my current Investments here here's the thing and this is a big deal These funds are more than placeholders they're income generators every month they pay me just for parking my cash that means I'm not only preserving my Capital but also growing it while keeping liquidity intact they're like a financial Pit Stop steady reliable and always ready to fuel the next leg of your portfolio's journey if you're not using cash parking funds you're absolutely leaving money on the table SNS and swvxx don't just keep your dry powder safe they they make sure it's earning until you're ready to make your next move in investing timing is everything and these funds keep you ready to win every portfolio needs a steady hand something you can rely on to perform even when the market goes Haywire that's SCD it's not flashy and it doesn't grab headlines but it does exactly what you need deliver consistent dividends from highquality companies that stand the test of time with a 3.78% dividend yield SD might not sound like a superstar but here's what makes it special reliability this ETF is built around Rock Solid dividend paying companies think household names with years of profitability under their belts these are businesses that know how to weather recessions adapt to Market changes and keep pumping out cash no matter what that stability you can count on here's why I'm watching SCD right now it's pulled back to the 200 day EMA for those unfamiliar the 200-day EMA is like a gravitational pull it often marks a critical price level where smart money steps in think of it as an on sale sign for a highquality ETF if you've been waiting for a signal to buy this is itd is the perfect counterbalance to a high yield ETF like jpq where jpq leverages technology growth and monthly payouts SD keeps things steady with quarterly dividends and a portfolio of Diversified established companies together they're like offense and defense one drives aggressive income and the other ensures long-term stab ability the magic ofd is in the compounding its dividends might be quarterly but over time they snowball into a powerful income stream pair that with its consistent performance and you've got a fund that not only pays you but grows with you this isn't a flashy investment it's a smart one if you're building a portfolio that lasts consider SCD it's not just another ETF it's the backbone of a strategy design to keep your income flowing while minimizing risk and dividend income is great but let's get one thing straight growth matters without it you're leaving a massive chunk of potential Returns on the table that's where SMH andg come in these ETFs aren't about dividends they're about capital appreciation plain and simple and if you're serious about building long-term wealth you need growth drivers like these in your portfolio let's start with SMH the semiconductor ETF semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology powering everything from AI to electric vehicles SMH doesn't just give you exposure to this high growth sector it's crushed it this year up 44.3 7% year to date it's not a dividend play but that didn't stop SMH from paying me $175.6 last month it's proof that even growth focused ETFs can contribute to your passive goals then there's SG a growth ETF that focuses on large cap companies with serious upside think of it as your ticket to owning the Googles and Amazon of the world without betting the farm on individual stocks year-to date scg is up 41.6 5% showing that growth isn't just theoretical its real measurable performance and while its dividend yield is a poultry. 35% it's the capital appreciation that makes this ETF invaluable in a balanced portfolio here's a thing that very few people talk about a portfolio built entirely on dividends might pay you today but it won't maximize your wealth tomorrow growth ETFs like SMH and SC HG give you the best of both worlds they let you capture upside in the Market's promising sectors while still contributing small but meaningful dividends to your overall income stream if you're skipping growth ETFs you're leaving potential gains on the table SNH andg ensure your portfolio isn't just paying you it's growing alongside you and when you pair them with dividend powerhouses like jeq and SCD you've got a strategy that delivers income today and capital appreciation for the future do you want to know the easiest way to lose money with dividends taxes Uncle Sam every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar that's not compounding for you that's why retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA are the Ultimate Weapon for dividend investors they don't just help you keep more of what you earn they supercharge your portfolio's growth over time let's start with the Roth IRA this account is a no-brainer if you qualify why because every dividend you earn and every dollar of growth is is 100% taxfree let's talk JQ its 10.1% dividend yield is a monster but here's the catch those dividends aren't qualified meaning they're taxed as ordinary income in a regular brokerage account that could be 22 32% or even more money gone before it ever compounds but in a Roth IRA you keep every single scent while the traditional IRA while it's not tax-free like a Roth It's still a massive Advantage dividends and gains grow tax deferred meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement this gives you Decades of compounding without Uncle Sam taking a cut if you're planning to reinvest dividends for growth the traditional IRA ensures you're reinvesting the full amount not the leftovers after taxes here's the deal these accounts are especially critical for high yield ETFs like jeq or cash parking funds like SNS XX their frequent payouts mean more opportunities for compounding and retirement accounts eliminate the tax drag that can eat into those returns it's a simple move that multiplies your money over time so if you're not using a retirement account for your dividend portfolio you're leaving serious money on the table whether it's a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA these accounts are the cheat code to building passive income faster and more efficiently maximize your contributions Park your ETFs inside and let time and compounding do the rest now let's talk results in December my portfolio paid me $574 that's not a projection or a back test it's real money straight into my account and here's the best part you don't need to reinvent the wheel to get results like this you just need the right mix of ETFs working together here's the breakdown jeq brought in $442 that's the heavy hitter delivering the bulk of my passive income with its massive 10.1% yield SNS added $954,000 27 giving me consistent returns while keeping my dry powder on standby SCD contributed $264 not huge but it's the stable Foundation that balances the portfolio swvxx threw in another $40.32 keeping my cash liquid and earning SMH added $175.6 and SG rounded things out with $118.99 together these ETFs generated near $6,000 in one month the key here isn't just the individual ETFs it's how they work together JQ and SNS handle the heavy lifting for monthly income SCD adds stability with its reliable quarterly payouts swvxx keeps cash on hand for flexibility and SMH andg inject growth ensuring the portfolio isn't just paying today but growing for tomorrow this isn't about chasing the highest yield or betting it all on one ETF it's about balance high yield growth stability and liquidity all play a role that's how you build a portfolio that performs in any Market Condition it's not magic it's strategy and here's the best part this approach scales whether you're starting with $10,000 $100,000 or even seven figures you can build a version of this portfolio that fits your goals the key is getting started the longer you wait the more income and growth you leave on the table so here's the bottom line my portfolio PA me $574 in December over $4,420 of that came from jpq proving it's the backbone of my passive income strategy but let's be clear this isn't a set it and forget it system every ETF in this portfolio plays a specific role and together they create a machine that generates consistent income while balancing growth and risk jeq is aggressive it thrives on technology which means if tech takes a hit so will JQ that's why SNS is my safety net providing stability and liquidity with a 4.1% yield SD is my stabilizer adding quarterly dividends from Rock Solid companies SW keeps my cash ready and earning while SMH andg bring growth to the table ensuring my portfolio grows alongside my income the beauty of this strategy is its scalability whether you're starting small or managing six figures you can build a version of this portfolio that works for you but here's the thing opportunities don't wait every day you're not compounding dividends is a day you're leaving money on the table so here's my challenge start now if you want to FASTT trck your results join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory it's a system I use to generate consistent income and it's working if you're serious about leveling up your investing don't wait the tools strategies and insights are right in front of you it's time to build your portfolio grow your income and take control of your financial future peace and I'll see you on the next video","The speaker outlines a strategic approach to generate approximately $5,742 in monthly passive income from a diversified portfolio of six Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), emphasizing a balance of high-yield income, stability, growth, and liquidity.

The core of this strategy revolves around:
*   **JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Identified as the primary income engine, contributing the majority of the monthly income (10.1% yield) via a covered call strategy on NASDAQ 100 stocks.
*   **SNSXX (Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund) & SWVXX (Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund):** Function as ""dry powder"" funds, ensuring liquidity and earning a yield (4.1-4.25%) while positioning for new investment opportunities.
*   **SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF):** Provides stability and consistent quarterly dividends (3.78%) from high-quality companies, currently seen as an opportune buying signal.
*   **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) & SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** Serve as ""growth drivers,"" focusing on capital appreciation in high-performing tech and semiconductor sectors.

A critical component of the strategy is tax efficiency, with a strong recommendation to utilize Roth or Traditional IRAs to maximize compounding and minimize tax liability on high-yield dividends. The overall philosophy stresses that passive income demands a consistent, balanced, and scalable strategy, not random stock picking, underscoring the importance of timely investment and compounding.",Google,0.95,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en you're stuck you've got 50,000 but you don't know how to make it work for you every day you wait you lose money stop playing small today we're putting jeq and scg head-to-head one is a cash flow monster the other a growth machine both crush the S&amp;P 500 but here's the kicker you don't have to choose just one you can play both to dominate the market stick around and I'll show you why not understanding these ETFs is costing you thousands here's the cold hard truth most people lose money because they don't know where to put it they stick with safe choices like the S&amp;P 500 and wonder why they're still behind after 10 years but you you're smarter than that and you've got options two options to be exact jeq and scg both are obliterating the S&amp;P 500 but they're doing it in radically different ways let's start with the numbers that matter over the last 3 years JQ delivered a jaw-dropping 50.3 n Total return scg not far behind with 41.46 per. compare that to the S&amp;P 500 limping in at 26.4% and it's clear these two ETFs are playing in a different League now let's zoom in on 2024 scg is the runaway leader in a bull market up 38.341101 dividend yield compare that to scg's laughable 4% and you see the trade-off SG is the hair sprinting ahead with growth jpq is the tortoise stacking cash flow consistently year after year the difference comes down to this jeq is a cash flow machine it thrives whether the market is going sideways or moderately up scg on the other hand is built to dominate in full-blown bull markets riding the wave of America's largest companies to incredible growth it's like choosing between a high octane sports car and a diesel truck both get the job done but in completely different ways here's the part that should blow your mind owning both is the ultimate power move with JQ you get steady income enough to reinvest compound or spend with scg you're setting yourself up for explosive long-term growth together they cover all your bases letting you win in any Market condition so the question isn't which ETF to choose the question is when are you going to stop wasting time and start making your money work harder let's talk about jpq this isn't just another ETF it's a cash printing machine built for investors who want income now jpq strategy isn't just smart it's ruthless it's designed to generate consistent cash flow no matter what the Market's doing and trust me it delivers here's how it works JQ invests in the biggest names in Tech Apple Microsoft Nvidia the companies dominating the NASDAQ but it doesn't stop there it writes covered call options on those Holdings translation jpq is earning extra cash on top of stock performance that's like your portfolio pulling double duty growing in value and generating premium income now let's talk results jq's 10.10% dividend yield is next level for every $50,000 you invest you're pocketing $5,050 a year just in dividends that's not potential that's actual cash hitting your account and that's before we even Factor in capital appreciation let's be honest finding yields like this from a legit ETF is like stumbling on a unicorn in the wild but and this is a big butt there's a trade-off jq's covered call strategy caps its upside in a Raging Bull Market when Tech stock sore the call option you WR limit how much of that growth you capture it's not a problem if you're after income but if you're chasing maximum price appreciation you might feel like you're leaving money on the table that said jpq thrives in markets where others falter sideways no problem slightly up still winning even during periods of high volatility the premium income from options acts as a cushion against big swings that's what makes jpq a powerhouse it's engineered for reliability in a market that's anything but the bottom line if you want income you can count on jbq isn't just good it's the best it's not flashy and it's not about explosive growth but if you want to get paid while staying invested in the hottest sectors of the market maret this ETF is a no-brainer stop chasing crumbs and start collecting real cash flow today SG is the ETF for growth Chasers if you're tired of waiting years for mediocre returns this fund is your rocket ship it's built for one purpose to grow your money faster than anything else in your portfolio and in 2024 it's proving exactly why it's a leader let's start with what makes scg tick this ETF tracks the Dow Jones US large cap growth index translation it's hand picking the most dominant us companies across Industries like Tech Healthcare and consumer goods we're talking about household names Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that move markets here's what separates scg from the pack it's uncapped unlike JQ there's no ceiling on your growth when the Market's on fire scg rides the wave all the way up that's why it's up 38.342230 38.3 let me repeat that HG is not your answer but if you're playing the long game and want to see your portfolio explode in value this is your weapon of choice another thing to love about scg diversification while Tech is its bread and butter it's not a one-trick pony scg balances its Holdings across multiple sectors to reduce risk that means even if one sector stumbles the ETF as a whole stays strong you're getting all the upside with less of the roller coaster ride the bottom line scg isn't for the faint of heart it's for investors who are ready to think bigger take on some risk and reap massive rewards if you're okay with letting your money grow instead of pulling cash today scg could be the smartest move you make this year and next let me hit you with a reality check picking one ETF is like trying to win a race with one leg tied behind your back jeq andg are built for different market conditions one gives you income now the other gives you explosive growth if you're only holding one I don't like leaving money on the table here's the deal JQ is perfect for markets that are sideways or moderately up it thrives by stacking premium income through covered call options that means you're still making money even when everyone else is complaining about flat returns it's your cash flow engine a reliable source of income no matter what the market throws at you now let's talk about scg this is your bull market beast when the Market's running hotg is the ETF sprinting ahead of the pack there's no cap on its growth so you're capturing all all of the upside that's why it's up 38.342230 Foundation it's steady reliable and pays you to hold itg is the rocket fuel it's volatile but it takes your portfolio to new heights when you combine the two you're setting yourself up to win no matter what the market does bull bear sideways it doesn't matter you're always playing offense so here's the question why limit yourself stop trying to pick the perfect ETF the smart money move is owning both diversify your strategy maximize your returns and dominate every Market condition that's how you build real wealth jeq is like the Swiss army knife of ETFs it's versatile efficient and built for one purpose putting cash in your pocket but before you dive in head first you need to understand the full picture every investment has its strengths and weaknesses and JQ is no different let's break it down the pros massive dividend yield jq's 10.10% dividend yield isn't just good it's jaw-dropping for every $50,000 you invest you're earning $5,050 annually in passive income that's like owning rental property without the tenants or maintenance headaches it's real money you can reinvest spend or save income in all markets unlike growth forecast ETFs that rely on the market going up jeq thrives in almost any Market flat you're still getting dividends slightly up you're winning even in volatility the covered call strategy cushions your portfolio by generating premium income Tech Focus portfolio jpq doesn't just invest in random companies it's port folio is stacked with the biggest names in technology Apple Microsoft Nvidia meta these companies are driving the economy forward and you're along for the ride built-in risk management the covered call strategy May cap your upside but it also protects you during Market down turns While others are panicking you're still cashing those dividends let's go over the cons capped growth here's the trade-off when tech stocks explode jq's growth is limited the covered call options cap your gains if you're looking for Max maximum price appreciation this might feel like a deal breaker Tech concentration while the tech focus is a strength it's also a risk if tech takes a nose dive JQ will feel the impact more than a diversified ETF jpq is not a long-term growth machine let's be honest jpq isn't for investors chasing massive capital appreciation it's for those who want income now not a 10x return in 20 years bottom line jpq is a cash flow Powerhouse if you need steady income or want to reinvest and compound aggressively it's the ETF for you but if you're chasing high growth potential it's not going to scratch that itch know what you're buying and use it strategically and scg it's like a purebred racehorse it's built to go fast and win big but before you bet the farm on it you need to understand both the highs and the trade-offs let's break down what makes scg the growth Investor's best friend and why it might not work for everyone the pros uncapped growth scg doesn't play safe there's no ceiling on how much your investment can grow if the Market's running hotg is sprinting right alongside it delivering massive gains that's why it's up 38.342230 for big wins across multiple Industries and then there's top tier Holdings scg is like an All-Star team of America's biggest companies Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that dominate their markets when these companies Thrive scg benefits directly a proven track record this isn't some experimental ETF scg has consistently delivered strong returns over time if you want reliability in the growth category this is it and now the cons PA pathetic dividend yield let's not sugarcoat it scg's 4% dividend yield is practically non-existent if you're looking for cash flow this is not the ETF for you you're reinvesting every penny into growth whether you want to or not a bull market Reliance scg shines when the market is booming but when things slow down it's not as reliable if you're banking on steady returns in a volatile or flat Market scg might leave you hanging and then we've got volatility risk growth focused ETFs like SG come with higher volatility big gains also mean potential for big swings if you can't stomach the roller coaster this isn't your ride so here's the bottom line scg is a pure growth machine it's for investors playing the long game willing to trade cash flow today for massive gains tomorrow if you're looking to build serious wealth and don't mind riding out the highs and the lows scg is your best bet but if you need steady income keep looking know your goals and use scg strategically here's the question everyone asks which one should I buy jeq or scg wrong question the real question is what's your plan because if you don't have a plan it doesn't matter what you invest in let me break it down for you if you're looking for immediate income something you can reinvest spend or save jpq is the obvious choice it's 10.10% dividend yield means you're getting paid now that's $5,050 a year on a $50,000 investment for retirees income invest investors or anyone who wants steady cash flow jpq delivers every time but if your goal is long-term growth building a portfolio that compounds into serious wealth then SG is where you want to be SG doesn't pay you today but it sets you up to win big in the future its UNCA growth potential makes it a Powerhouse in Bull markets up in fact the smartest move is to own both why because jpq andg complement each other jpq gives you reliable cash flow that can stabilize your portfolio or fuel reinvestment SG gives you the long-term growth that builds wealth over decades think about it like this jpq is your safety net it's steady predictable and pays you to hold itg is your growth driver it's fast aggressive and focused on delivering big returns together they're the ultimate investing do you're playing offense and defense at the same time and here's the kicker timing matters if you're close to retirement or need passive income lean heavier into jeq if you're younger or have time to write out the markets ups and downs prioritize scg but no matter your age owning both sets you up to win in any Market condition so stop wasting time trying to pick the perfect ETF use jpq and scg strategically invest with purpose maximize your return turns and watch your portfolio thrive in any environment here's where things get real you've got $50,000 and the clock's ticking every day that cash sits idle inflation is eating away at it and you're missing out on compounding growth so what's the play Simple split it between JQ and SG to build a portfolio that pays you now and sets you up for the future let's start with JQ put $25,000 into this cash flow beast and you're looking at $2,525 in annual dividends no strings attached that's real money hitting your account every quarter like clockwork reinvest it and you're accelerating your compounding spend it and you've got passive income to enjoy either way jpq is the reliable income engine every portfolio needs now take the other $225,000 and park it ing this is your growth driver with scg's 38.342230 your portfolio sure there's no dividend payout but that's the trade-off for uncapped growth over time scg's compounding potential will outpace almost anything else in the market here's the Magic by combining these two ETFs you're hedging against Market uncertainty bull market scg explodes in value sideways are slightly up jpq keeps pumping out cash flow together they're Unstoppable you're playing offense and defense at the same time ensuring your portfolio thrives in

use them do you want more strategies like this join my patreon for realtime alerts TP plays and daily insights into the hottest moves in the market the links in the description don't wait for the perfect time to invest the perfect time is right now peace and I'll see you on the next video","This YouTube video, ""JEPQ vs SCHG: $50k Invested → Which ETF Is better?"", strongly advocates against keeping money idle and argues that the S&P 500 is too slow for significant wealth creation. It instead recommends a combined investment strategy using JEPQ and SCHG to dominate various market conditions.

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls. It excels in sideways or moderately up markets and offers volatility protection, but its upside is capped during strong bull runs.
*   **SCHG (""Growth Machine""):** This ETF is recommended for long-term capital appreciation, tracking the Dow Jones US Large Cap Growth index with a focus on dominant US companies. It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.
*   **Combined Strategy (""Ultimate Investing Duo""):** The video asserts that a 50/50 split of JEPQ and SCHG for a $50,000 investment allows investors to ""win in any market condition."" JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").
*   **Supercharging Growth:** A crucial recommendation is to reinvest JEPQ's high dividends into SCHG to ""supercharge"" compounding, creating a ""compounding snowball.""

use them do you want more strategies like this join my patreon for realtime alerts TP plays and daily insights into the hottest moves in the market the links in the description don't wait for the perfect time to invest the perfect time is right now peace and I'll see you on the next video","This YouTube video, ""JEPQ vs SCHG: $50k Invested → Which ETF Is better?"", strongly advocates against keeping money idle and argues that the S&P 500 is too slow for significant wealth creation. It instead recommends a combined investment strategy using JEPQ and SCHG to dominate various market conditions.

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls. It excels in sideways or moderately up markets and offers volatility protection, but its upside is capped during strong bull runs.
*   **SCHG (""Growth Machine""):** This ETF is recommended for long-term capital appreciation, tracking the Dow Jones US Large Cap Growth index with a focus on dominant US companies. It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.
*   **Combined Strategy (""Ultimate Investing Duo""):** The video asserts that a 50/50 split of JEPQ and SCHG for a $50,000 investment allows investors to ""win in any market condition."" JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").
*   **Supercharging Growth:** A crucial recommendation is to reinvest JEPQ's high dividends into SCHG to ""supercharge"" compounding, creating a ""compounding snowball.""
*   **Performance:** Both ETFs have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over three years (JEPQ 50.39%, SCHG 41.46% vs. S&P 500 26.4%), with SCHG leading year-to-date (38.34% vs. JEPQ 11.01%).
*   **Urgency:** The speaker emphasizes that ""every day you wait you lose money"" due to inflation and missed compounding, urging immediate action and stating, ""the perfect time to invest is right now."" Allocation should consider age, with older investors favoring JEPQ for income and younger ones prioritizing SCHG for growth.",SCHG,0.9,0.7

perfect time to invest the perfect time is right now peace and I'll see you on the next video","This YouTube video, ""JEPQ vs SCHG: $50k Invested → Which ETF Is better?"", strongly advocates against keeping money idle and argues that the S&P 500 is too slow for significant wealth creation. It instead recommends a combined investment strategy using JEPQ and SCHG to dominate various market conditions.

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls. It excels in sideways or moderately up markets and offers volatility protection, but its upside is capped during strong bull runs.
*   **SCHG (""Growth Machine""):** This ETF is recommended for long-term capital appreciation, tracking the Dow Jones US Large Cap Growth index with a focus on dominant US companies. It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.
*   **Combined Strategy (""Ultimate Investing Duo""):** The video asserts that a 50/50 split of JEPQ and SCHG for a $50,000 investment allows investors to ""win in any market condition."" JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").
*   **Supercharging Growth:** A crucial recommendation is to reinvest JEPQ's high dividends into SCHG to ""supercharge"" compounding, creating a ""compounding snowball.""
*   **Performance:** Both ETFs have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over three years (JEPQ 50.39%, SCHG 41.46% vs. S&P 500 26.4%), with SCHG leading year-to-date (38.34% vs. JEPQ 11.01%).
*   **Urgency:** The speaker emphasizes that ""every day you wait you lose money"" due to inflation and missed compounding, urging immediate action and stating, ""the perfect time to invest is right now."" Allocation should consider age, with older investors favoring JEPQ for income and younger ones prioritizing SCHG for growth.",S&P 500,0.8,-0.3

owning both diversify your strategy maximize your returns and dominate every Market condition that's how you build real wealth jeq is like the Swiss army knife of ETFs it's versatile efficient and built for one purpose putting cash in your pocket but before you dive in head first you need to understand the full picture every investment has its strengths and weaknesses and JQ is no different let's break it down the pros massive dividend yield jq's 10.10% dividend yield isn't just good it's jaw-dropping for every $50,000 you invest you're earning $5,050 annually in passive income that's like owning rental property without the tenants or maintenance headaches it's real money you can reinvest spend or save income in all markets unlike growth forecast ETFs that rely on the market going

forward and you're along for the ride built-in risk management the covered call strategy May cap your upside but it also protects you during Market down turns While others are panicking you're still

maximum price appreciation this might feel like a deal breaker Tech concentration while the tech focus is a strength it's also a risk if tech takes a nose dive JQ will feel the impact more than a diversified ETF jpq is not a long-term growth machine let's be honest jpq isn't for investors chasing massive capital appreciation it's for those who want income now not a 10x return in 20 years bottom line jpq is a cash flow Powerhouse if you need steady income or want to reinvest and compound aggressively it's the ETF for you but if you're chasing high growth potential it's not going to scratch that itch know what you're buying and use it strategically and scg it's like a purebred racehorse it's built to go fast and win big but before you bet the farm on it you need to understand both the highs and the trade-offs let's break down what makes scg the growth Investor's best friend and why it might not work for everyone the pros uncapped growth scg doesn't play safe there's no ceiling on how much your investment can grow if the Market's running hotg is sprinting right alongside it delivering massive gains that's why it's up 38.342230 for big wins across multiple Industries and then there's top tier Holdings scg is like an All-Star team of America's biggest companies Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that dominate their markets when these companies Thrive scg benefits directly a proven track record this isn't some experimental ETF scg has consistently delivered strong returns over time if you want reliability in the growth category this is it and now the cons PA pathetic dividend yield let's not sugarcoat it scg's 4% dividend yield is practically non-existent if you're looking for cash flow this is not the ETF for you you're reinvesting every penny into growth whether you want to or not a bull market Reliance scg shines when the market is booming but when things slow down it's not as reliable if you're banking on steady returns in a volatile or flat Market scg might leave you hanging and then we've got volatility risk growth focused ETFs like SG come with higher volatility big gains also mean potential for big swings if you can't stomach the roller coaster this isn't your ride so here's the bottom line scg is a pure growth machine it's for investors playing the long game willing to trade cash flow today for massive gains tomorrow if you're looking to build serious wealth and don't mind riding out the highs and the lows scg is your best bet but if you need steady income keep looking know your goals and use scg strategically here's the question everyone asks which one should I buy jeq or scg wrong question the real question is what's your plan because if you don't have a plan it doesn't matter what you invest in let me break it down for you if you're looking for immediate income something you can reinvest spend or save jpq is the obvious choice it's 10.10% dividend yield means you're getting paid now that's $5,050 a year on a $50,000 investment for retirees income invest investors or anyone who wants steady cash flow jpq delivers every time but if your goal is long-term growth building a portfolio that compounds into serious wealth then SG is where you want to be SG doesn't pay you today but it sets you up to win big in the future its UNCA growth potential makes it a Powerhouse in Bull markets up in fact the smartest move is to own both why because jpq andg complement each other jpq gives you reliable cash flow that can stabilize your portfolio or fuel reinvestment SG gives you the long-term growth that builds wealth over decades think about it like this jpq is your safety net it's steady predictable and pays you to hold itg is your growth driver it's fast aggressive and focused on delivering big returns together they're the ultimate investing do you're playing offense and defense at the same time and here's the kicker timing matters if you're close to retirement or need passive income lean heavier into jeq if you're younger or have time to write out the markets ups and downs prioritize scg but no matter your age owning both sets you up to win in any Market condition so stop wasting time trying to pick the perfect ETF use jpq and scg strategically invest with purpose maximize your return turns and watch your portfolio thrive in any environment here's where things get real you've got

keeping money idle and argues that the S&P 500 is too slow for significant wealth creation. It instead recommends a combined investment strategy using JEPQ and SCHG to dominate various market conditions.

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls. It excels in sideways or moderately up markets and offers volatility protection, but its upside is capped during strong bull runs.
*   **SCHG (""Growth Machine""):** This ETF is recommended for long-term capital appreciation, tracking the Dow Jones US Large Cap Growth index with a focus on dominant US companies. It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.
*   **Combined Strategy (""Ultimate Investing Duo""):** The video asserts that a 50/50 split of JEPQ and SCHG for a $50,000 investment allows investors to ""win in any market condition."" JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").
*   **Supercharging Growth:** A crucial recommendation is to reinvest JEPQ's high dividends into SCHG to ""supercharge"" compounding, creating a ""compounding snowball.""
*   **Performance:** Both ETFs have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over three years (JEPQ 50.39%, SCHG 41.46% vs. S&P 500 26.4%), with SCHG leading year-to-date (38.34% vs. JEPQ 11.01%).
*   **Urgency:** The speaker emphasizes that ""every day you wait you lose money"" due to inflation and missed compounding, urging immediate action and stating, ""the perfect time to invest is right now."" Allocation should consider age, with older investors favoring JEPQ for income and younger ones prioritizing SCHG for growth.",Microsoft,1.0,0.5

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls.

It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.

JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").

*   **Urgency:** The speaker emphasizes that ""every day you wait you lose money"" due to inflation and missed compounding, urging immediate action and stating, ""the perfect time to invest is right now.""

scg not far behind with 41.46 per. compare that to the S&amp;P 500 limping in at 26.4% and it's clear these two ETFs are playing in a different League now let's zoom in on 2024 scg is the runaway

completely different ways here's the part that should blow your mind owning both is the ultimate power move with JQ you get steady income enough to reinvest compound or spend with scg you're setting yourself up for explosive long-term growth together they cover all your bases letting you win in any Market condition so the question isn't which ETF to choose the question is when are you going to stop wasting time and start making your money work harder let's talk about jpq this isn't just another ETF it's a cash printing machine built for investors who want income now jpq strategy isn't just smart it's ruthless it's designed to generate consistent cash flow no matter what the Market's doing and trust me it delivers here's how it works JQ invests in the biggest names in Tech Apple Microsoft Nvidia the companies dominating the NASDAQ but it doesn't stop there it writes covered call options on those Holdings translation jpq is earning extra cash on top of stock performance that's like your portfolio pulling double duty growing in value and generating premium income now let's talk results jq's 10.10% dividend yield is next level for every $50,000 you invest you're pocketing $5,050 a year just in dividends that's not potential that's actual cash hitting your account and that's before we even Factor in capital appreciation let's be honest finding yields like this from a legit ETF is like stumbling on a unicorn in the wild but and this is a big butt there's a trade-off jq's covered call strategy caps its upside in a Raging Bull Market when Tech stock sore the call option you WR limit how much of that growth you capture it's not a problem if you're after income but if you're chasing maximum price appreciation you might feel like you're leaving money on the table that said jpq thrives in markets where others falter sideways no problem slightly up still winning even during periods of high volatility the premium income from options acts as a cushion against big swings that's what makes jpq a powerhouse it's engineered for reliability in a market that's anything but the bottom line if you want income you can count on jbq isn't just good it's the best it's not flashy and it's not about explosive growth but if you want to get paid while staying invested in the hottest sectors of the market maret this ETF is a no-brainer stop chasing crumbs and start collecting real cash flow today SG is the ETF for growth Chasers if you're tired of waiting years for mediocre returns this fund is your rocket ship it's built for one purpose to grow your money faster than anything else in your portfolio and in 2024 it's proving exactly why it's a leader let's start with what makes scg tick this ETF tracks the Dow Jones US large cap growth index translation it's hand picking the most dominant us companies across Industries like Tech Healthcare and consumer goods we're talking about household names Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that move markets here's what separates scg from the pack it's uncapped unlike JQ there's no ceiling on your growth when the Market's on fire scg rides the wave all the way up that's why it's up 38.342230 38.3 let me repeat that HG is not your answer but if you're playing the long game and want to see your portfolio explode in value this is your weapon of choice another thing to love about scg diversification while Tech is its bread and butter it's not a one-trick pony scg balances its Holdings across multiple sectors to reduce risk that means even if one sector stumbles the ETF as a whole stays strong you're getting all the upside with less of the roller coaster ride the bottom line scg isn't for the faint of heart it's for investors who are ready to think bigger take on some risk and reap massive rewards if you're okay with letting your money grow instead of pulling cash today scg could be the smartest move you make this year and next let me hit you with a reality check picking one ETF is like

JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en you're stuck you've got 50,000 but you don't know how to make it work for you every day you wait you lose money stop playing small today we're putting jeq and scg head-to-head one is a cash flow monster the other a growth machine both crush the S&amp;P 500 but here's the kicker you don't have to choose just one you can play both to dominate the market stick around and I'll show you why not understanding these ETFs is costing you thousands here's the cold hard truth most people lose money because they don't know where to put it they stick with safe choices like the S&amp;P 500 and wonder why they're still behind after 10 years but you you're smarter than that and you've got options two options to be exact jeq and scg both are obliterating the S&amp;P 500 but they're doing it in radically different ways let's start with the numbers that matter over the last 3 years JQ delivered a jaw-dropping 50.3 n Total return scg not far behind with 41.46 per. compare that to the S&amp;P 500 limping in at 26.4% and it's clear these two ETFs are playing in a different League now let's zoom in on 2024 scg is the runaway leader in a bull market up 38.341101 dividend yield compare that to scg's laughable 4% and you see the trade-off SG is the hair sprinting ahead with growth jpq is the tortoise stacking cash flow consistently year after year the difference comes down to this jeq is a cash flow machine it thrives whether the market is going sideways or moderately up scg on the other hand is built to dominate in full-blown bull markets riding the wave of America's largest companies to incredible growth it's like choosing between a high octane sports car and a diesel truck both get the job done but in completely different ways here's the part that should blow your mind owning both is the ultimate power move with JQ you get steady income enough to reinvest compound or spend with scg you're setting yourself up for explosive long-term growth together they cover all your bases letting you win in any Market condition so the question isn't which ETF to choose the question is when are you going to stop wasting time and start making your money work harder let's talk about jpq this isn't just another ETF it's a cash printing machine built for investors who want income now jpq strategy isn't just smart it's ruthless it's designed to generate consistent cash flow no matter what the Market's doing and trust me it delivers here's how it works JQ invests in the biggest names in Tech Apple Microsoft Nvidia the companies dominating the NASDAQ but it doesn't stop there it writes covered call options on those Holdings translation jpq is earning extra cash on top of stock performance that's like your portfolio pulling double duty growing in value and generating premium income now let's talk results jq's 10.10% dividend yield is next level for every $50,000 you invest you're pocketing $5,050 a year just in dividends that's not potential that's actual cash hitting your account and that's before we even Factor in capital appreciation let's be honest finding yields like this from a legit ETF is like stumbling on a unicorn in the wild but and this is a big butt there's a trade-off jq's covered call strategy caps its upside in a Raging Bull Market when Tech stock sore the call option you WR limit how much of that growth you capture it's not a problem if you're after income but if you're chasing maximum price appreciation you might feel like you're leaving money on the table that said jpq thrives in markets where others falter sideways no problem slightly up still winning even during periods of high volatility the premium income from options acts as a cushion against big swings that's what makes jpq a powerhouse it's engineered for reliability in a market that's anything but the bottom line if you want income you can count on jbq isn't just good it's the best it's not flashy and it's not about explosive growth but if you want to get paid while staying invested in the hottest sectors of the market maret this ETF is a no-brainer stop chasing crumbs and start collecting real cash flow today SG is the ETF for growth Chasers if you're tired of waiting years for mediocre returns this fund is your rocket ship it's built for one purpose to grow your money faster than anything else in your portfolio and in 2024 it's proving exactly why it's a leader let's start with what makes scg tick this ETF tracks the Dow Jones US large cap growth index translation it's hand picking the most dominant us companies across Industries like Tech Healthcare and consumer goods we're talking about household names Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that move markets here's what separates scg from the pack it's uncapped unlike JQ there's no ceiling on your growth when the Market's on fire scg rides the wave all the way up that's why it's up 38.342230 38.3 let me repeat that HG is not your answer but if you're playing the long game and want to see your portfolio explode in value this is your weapon of choice another thing to love about scg diversification while Tech is its bread and butter it's not a one-trick pony scg balances its Holdings across multiple sectors to reduce risk that means even if one sector stumbles the ETF as a whole stays strong you're getting all the upside with less of the roller coaster ride the bottom line scg isn't for the faint of heart it's for investors who are ready to think bigger take on some risk and reap massive rewards if you're okay with letting your money grow instead of pulling cash today scg could be the smartest move you make this year and next let me hit you with a reality check picking one ETF is like trying to win a race with one leg tied behind your back jeq andg are built for different market conditions one gives you income now the other gives you explosive growth if you're only holding one I don't like leaving money on the table here's the deal JQ is perfect for markets that are sideways or moderately up it thrives by stacking premium income through covered call options that means you're still making money even when everyone else is complaining about flat returns it's your cash flow engine a reliable source of income no matter what the market throws at you now let's talk about scg this is your bull market beast when the Market's running hotg is the ETF sprinting ahead of the pack there's no cap on its growth so you're capturing all all of the upside that's why it's up 38.342230 Foundation it's steady reliable and pays you to hold itg is the rocket fuel it's volatile but it takes your portfolio to new heights when you combine the two you're setting yourself up to win no matter what the market does bull bear sideways it doesn't matter you're always playing offense so here's the question why limit yourself stop trying to pick the perfect ETF the smart money move is owning both diversify your strategy maximize your returns and dominate every Market condition that's how you build real wealth jeq is like the Swiss army knife of ETFs it's versatile efficient and built for one purpose putting cash in your pocket but before you dive in head first you need to understand the full picture every investment has its strengths and weaknesses and JQ is no different let's break it down the pros massive dividend yield jq's 10.10% dividend yield isn't just good it's jaw-dropping for every $50,000 you invest you're earning $5,050 annually in passive income that's like owning rental property without the tenants or maintenance headaches it's real money you can reinvest spend or save income in all markets unlike growth forecast ETFs that rely on the market going up jeq thrives in almost any Market flat you're still getting dividends slightly up you're winning even in volatility the covered call strategy cushions your portfolio by generating premium income Tech Focus portfolio jpq doesn't just invest in random companies it's port folio is stacked with the biggest names in technology Apple Microsoft Nvidia meta these companies are driving the economy forward and you're along for the ride built-in risk management the covered call strategy May cap your upside but it also protects you during Market down turns While others are panicking you're still cashing those dividends let's go over the cons capped growth here's the trade-off when tech stocks explode jq's growth is limited the covered call options cap your gains if you're looking for Max maximum price appreciation this might feel like a deal breaker Tech concentration while the tech focus is a strength it's also a risk if tech takes a nose dive JQ will feel the impact more than a diversified ETF jpq is not a long-term growth machine let's be honest jpq isn't for investors chasing massive capital appreciation it's for those who want income now not a 10x return in 20 years bottom line jpq is a cash flow Powerhouse if you need steady income or want to reinvest and compound aggressively it's the ETF for you but if you're chasing high growth potential it's not going to scratch that itch know what you're buying and use it strategically and scg it's like a purebred racehorse it's built to go fast and win big but before you bet the farm on it you need to understand both the highs and the trade-offs let's break down what makes scg the growth Investor's best friend and why it might not work for everyone the pros uncapped growth scg doesn't play safe there's no ceiling on how much your investment can grow if the Market's running hotg is sprinting right alongside it delivering massive gains that's why it's up 38.342230 for big wins across multiple Industries and then there's top tier Holdings scg is like an All-Star team of America's biggest companies Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla the Giants that dominate their markets when these companies Thrive scg benefits directly a proven track record this isn't some experimental ETF scg has consistently delivered strong returns over time if you want reliability in the growth category this is it and now the cons PA pathetic dividend yield let's not sugarcoat it scg's 4% dividend yield is practically non-existent if you're looking for cash flow this is not the ETF for you you're reinvesting every penny into growth whether you want to or not a bull market Reliance scg shines when the market is booming but when things slow down it's not as reliable if you're banking on steady returns in a volatile or flat Market scg might leave you hanging and then we've got volatility risk growth focused ETFs like SG come with higher volatility big gains also mean potential for big swings if you can't stomach the roller coaster this isn't your ride so here's the bottom line scg is a pure growth machine it's for investors playing the long game willing to trade cash flow today for massive gains tomorrow if you're looking to build serious wealth and don't mind riding out the highs and the lows scg is your best bet but if you need steady income keep looking know your goals and use scg strategically here's the question everyone asks which one should I buy jeq or scg wrong question the real question is what's your plan because if you don't have a plan it doesn't matter what you invest in let me break it down for you if you're looking for immediate income something you can reinvest spend or save jpq is the obvious choice it's 10.10% dividend yield means you're getting paid now that's $5,050 a year on a $50,000 investment for retirees income invest investors or anyone who wants steady cash flow jpq delivers every time but if your goal is long-term growth building a portfolio that compounds into serious wealth then SG is where you want to be SG doesn't pay you today but it sets you up to win big in the future its UNCA growth potential makes it a Powerhouse in Bull markets up in fact the smartest move is to own both why because jpq andg complement each other jpq gives you reliable cash flow that can stabilize your portfolio or fuel reinvestment SG gives you the long-term growth that builds wealth over decades think about it like this jpq is your safety net it's steady predictable and pays you to hold itg is your growth driver it's fast aggressive and focused on delivering big returns together they're the ultimate investing do you're playing offense and defense at the same time and here's the kicker timing matters if you're close to retirement or need passive income lean heavier into jeq if you're younger or have time to write out the markets ups and downs prioritize scg but no matter your age owning both sets you up to win in any Market condition so stop wasting time trying to pick the perfect ETF use jpq and scg strategically invest with purpose maximize your return turns and watch your portfolio thrive in any environment here's where things get real you've got $50,000 and the clock's ticking every day that cash sits idle inflation is eating away at it and you're missing out on compounding growth so what's the play Simple split it between JQ and SG to build a portfolio that pays you now and sets you up for the future let's start with JQ put $25,000 into this cash flow beast and you're looking at $2,525 in annual dividends no strings attached that's real money hitting your account every quarter like clockwork reinvest it and you're accelerating your compounding spend it and you've got passive income to enjoy either way jpq is the reliable income engine every portfolio needs now take the other $225,000 and park it ing this is your growth driver with scg's 38.342230 your portfolio sure there's no dividend payout but that's the trade-off for uncapped growth over time scg's compounding potential will outpace almost anything else in the market here's the Magic by combining these two ETFs you're hedging against Market uncertainty bull market scg explodes in value sideways are slightly up jpq keeps pumping out cash flow together they're Unstoppable you're playing offense and defense at the same time ensuring your portfolio thrives in almost any Market Market condition do you want to supercharge this strategy reinvest every dollar jpq pays you back into scg now you've got income feeding growth creating a compounding snowball that accelerates over time it's simple math the more you reinvest the faster your portfolio grows and let's be real $50,000 today reinvested smartly could be worth a lot more than $50,000 tomorrow but here's the thing you've got to take action watching videos won't grow your portfolio thinking about investing won't build wealth only action moves the needle JQ and scg are the tools it's up to you to use them do you want more strategies like this join my patreon for realtime alerts TP plays and daily insights into the hottest moves in the market the links in the description don't wait for the perfect time to invest the perfect time is right now peace and I'll see you on the next video","This YouTube video, ""JEPQ vs SCHG: $50k Invested → Which ETF Is better?"", strongly advocates against keeping money idle and argues that the S&P 500 is too slow for significant wealth creation. It instead recommends a combined investment strategy using JEPQ and SCHG to dominate various market conditions.

**Key Insights:**

*   **JEPQ (""Cash Flow Monster""):** This ETF is recommended for immediate income, generating a 10.10% dividend yield by investing in NASDAQ tech giants and writing covered calls. It excels in sideways or moderately up markets and offers volatility protection, but its upside is capped during strong bull runs.
*   **SCHG (""Growth Machine""):** This ETF is recommended for long-term capital appreciation, tracking the Dow Jones US Large Cap Growth index with a focus on dominant US companies. It offers uncapped growth potential, performing best in strong bull markets, but provides a negligible dividend and is more volatile.
*   **Combined Strategy (""Ultimate Investing Duo""):** The video asserts that a 50/50 split of JEPQ and SCHG for a $50,000 investment allows investors to ""win in any market condition."" JEPQ provides reliable income and stability (acting as a ""safety net""), while SCHG delivers aggressive long-term growth (as ""rocket fuel"").
*   **Supercharging Growth:** A crucial recommendation is to reinvest JEPQ's high dividends into SCHG to ""supercharge"" compounding, creating a ""compounding snowball.""
*   **Performance:** Both ETFs have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over three years (JEPQ 50.39%, SCHG 41.46% vs. S&P 500 26.4%), with SCHG leading year-to-date (38.34% vs. JEPQ 11.01%).
*   **Urgency:** The speaker emphasizes that ""every day you wait you lose money"" due to inflation and missed compounding, urging immediate action and stating, ""the perfect time to invest is right now."" Allocation should consider age, with older investors favoring JEPQ for income and younger ones prioritizing SCHG for growth.",Dow Jones,0.9,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en stop complicating your investing you're struggling with this Market because you think you're smarter than the market you're not most people chase shiny stocks time the market and lose here's the truth if you want to get rich invest in these three TFS that already work I'm talking insane growth fat dividends and almost zero effort scg jeq and voo these are the three ETFs that are crushing the markets by the end of this video you'll have a bulletproof plan to start building real wealth today no excuses no fluff let's go most people lose at investing because they make two critical mistakes they think they're smarter than they are and they ignore what already works you pick stocks you try to time the market and you chase shiny objects here's the truth most people suck at it and the stats prove it let me break this down if you invested in the three ETFs I'm about to show you scg jeq and Vu your results would crush 90% of the people trying to beat the market here's the data SC HG 48.3 5% Total return over 3 years jeq 51.4% Total return over 3 years with a 10.1% dividend yield and vu 36.21465 then what you miss the recovery every single time the best investors don't act like this Buffet doesn't sell when the market dips he buys that's why Warren Buffett is the goat the difference between you and Warren he keeps it simple you don't so here's the wakeup call if you're losing money it's not because investing is hard it's because you're making it hard stop the strategy works these ETFs work you just need to act if you're tired of losing listen up this video will change how invest you want growth you want to build real wealth chg is how you do itg stand chg stands for the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and this is where the winners live companies like apple Microsoft Amazon and Google the Giants the Unstoppable innovators these aren't cheap penny stocks this is the future here's whyg is so powerful it's simple it focuses on the companies that are already winning and guess what they keep winning let's look at the numbers because the numbers don't lie scg is up 42% year-to date in the last 3 months 15% the expense ratio 0.4% basically it's free to hold compare that to some actively management funds charging you 1% 2% or even more while underperforming you're getting ripped off scg lets you hold the best companies for pennies so why aren't more people buying it simple they're distracted they're chasing small cap stocks that might blow up meme stocks with hype but no profits and other trash stop doing that if you want consistent massive growth buy scg period scg doesn't gamble it bets on the Giants and the Giants don't lose these companies dominate their Industries they have the cash the scale and the growth you're not betting on potential you're betting on Proven Winners Action step buy chg now don't wait every day you're out of the market you're leaving money on the table if you want growth stop guessing and start winning let's talk about jeq the ETF that pays you to be patient you want growth you want cash flow JQ gives you both here's how it works jeq focuses on Tech the NASDAQ giants like Microsoft Apple and Google but here's the twist it pays you a fat monthly dividend right now that dividend yield is 10.1% let me put that in perspective you put $10,000 into jeq you're collecting over $1,000 a year just in dividends that's real passive income and while you're getting paid your investment is still growing year to date jeq is up 177% and the dividends and the total return this year 27.5 4% but here's the real kicker I'm not just telling you this I'm heavily invested in jeq on December 4th my jeq dividend checks totaled $4 4,426 193 that's over 4 grand in passive income in one month imagine seeing that hit your account now here's why I own jpq along withg and Vu sure I do a lot of aggressive investing I chase big opportunities when I see them but jbq scg and Vu are the foundation of my portfolio why because they work they give me much needed stability and consistent growth while everyone else is panicking these ETFs let me sleep at night most people ignore ETFs like jpq because they think it's boring guess what the boring stuff makes you rich dividends compound growth Stacks jpq does both bottom line jpq is a no-brainer you get Tech growth and massive income stop betting on hype start building real wealth the action step here just buy JQ take the cash reinvest it don't wait every month you sit out you're losing money if you're serious about getting rich you need vo this is the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF and it's the single best investment for building long-term wealth why because Vu tracks the S&amp;P 500 the top 500 companies in America think Apple Microsoft Coca-Cola Google Tesla the Giants the companies that drive the entire economy let me hit you with the numbers year-to dat Vu is up 28.521220 and fail the S&amp;P 500 has delivered consistent returns for decades it's a proven wealth buing machine Warren Buffett himself says if you don't know what you're doing and let's be real you don't just buy the S&amp;P 500 vo is perfect for two reasons one it's safe you're spreading your money across the 500 biggest companies two it's simple no stock picking no timing you buy vo and you hold it that's it most investors screw this up because they think safe mean slow wrong the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 10% annual returns for decades you double your money every 7 years without lifting a finger that's not slow that's Unstoppable the bottom line Vu is the foundation without it your portfolio is weak scg gives you growth jeq gives you cash flow vo gives you rock solid stability your action step buy vo keep buying it every month build your foundation this is how you win here's the problem most investors have portfolios that are all over the place random stocks overlap no plan that's why they lose you don't need 20 stocks you need three ETFs scg jeq and vo because together they're the perfect team for a simple portfolio each one has a role SD is your growth engine it targets large cap companies growing fast Amazon Apple Microsoft the titans of innovation it's like rocket fuel for your money jeq gives you cash cash flow and growth it pays you a 10.1% dividend yield every month while still riding the upside of tech that's rare and vo it's your stability it tracks the S&amp;P 500 and delivers consistent long-term gains with almost no risk think of it like this scg is offense JQ is your steady income and vo is defense together they cover all the bases growth cash flow and stability here's the magic there's very little overlap scg and jeq focus on growth but jpq adds dividends vo balances it all out by spreading risk across the top 500 companies in America you're not Overexposed to any one stock and you're not missing out on growth or income the average investor overthinks they complicate their portfolios and end up losing money you you keep it simple these three ETFs give you everything you need to build massive wealth your action step buy all three split your money evenly automate monthly Investments growth income stability done if you're not doing this you're making it harder than it needs to be stop guessing start compounding most people panic when the market dips they see red freak out and sell everything that's why they stay broke you know what smart investors do they buy here's the truth pullbacks are not the end of the world they're opportunities to get rich stocks don't go up in a straight line and neither do ETFs scg JQ and vo will have pullbacks and when they do you should thank the market why because pullbacks let you buy assets at a discount let's say scg drops 10% if you believe in apple Amazon and Microsoft then it's on sale you wouldn't freak out if your favorite sneakers drop 10% in price you'd buy two pairs this is the same thing the difference between people who get rich and people who lose the rich love pullbacks they buy when everyone else is scared it's that simple one Buffett calls this Being Greedy when others are fearful you don't need a crystal ball to win you just need the guts to buy when the market hands you a deal here's the move for this 3 ETF portfolio stop checking this portfolio every day when scg JQ or vo pull back don't sell Don't Panic buy more add to your position pullbacks are a cheat code for long-term wealth over time the market goes up history proves this if you're not buying during the dips you're sabotaging your future self you're action step when you see red see opportunity buy the dip buy more keep holding that's how wealth is built you will not time the market you think you can you're wrong nobody can consistently Warren Buffett doesn't even try and yet most people sit on the sidelines waiting for the perfect time to invest guess what that perfect time doesn't exist here's the reality if you're not in the market you're losing money inflation is eating your cash the market is moving without you so stop overthinking and start using the single best strategy for regular people dollar cost averaging or DCA here's how it works you pick an amount $100 $500 $1,000 a month and you invest it into scg jeq and vo every single month whether the market is up down or sideways you keep investing it's automatic it's foolproof here's why it works when prices drop you're buying more shares when prices go up the shares you already own are worth with more over time you're guaranteed to get an average price you're not timing the market you're beating it with consistency look at history the market has gone up over time averaging about 10% annual returns if you invest consistently you don't need to worry about short-term dips headlines or crashes DCA removes emotion it removes Panic it removes guesswork and the reason why most people fail they try to time the market get scared during dips or sit out waiting for a miracle you you stick to the plan you invest every month no matter what the action step automate your Investments set up a monthly buy for scg jeq and vo never stop the market rewards patience this is how average people can get rich so here's the deal if you're serious about Building Wealth you need a plan not a theory not a maybe a step-by-step game plan you can follow right now here's exactly what to do buy scg JQ and Vo split your money evenly across all three no second guessing set up the automatic Investments this is dollar cost averaging whether you have a1500 or $10,000 a month to invest just commit to it and then ignore the noise stop checking your portfolio every day stop listening to Market gurus predicting Doom and Gloom focus on the long-term upside and remember scg gives you massive growth from the fastest growing companies in the world jpq pays you cash flow while still riding the upside of te and vo gives you stability it doesn't matter if there's a recession or a boom over time these ETFs will grow your wealth while everyone else panics guesses and loses here's the reality today I've handed you a 3 ETF portfolio that anyone can use to get rich but if you're the type of person who really wants to step up your game who wants to move faster get sharper insights and take investing to the next level then join my patreon inside I give you realtime trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory these are actionable moves you can use to stay ahead of the curve if you're ready to level up and stop guessing join the patreon the Link's in the description stop waiting and start Building Wealth peace and I'll see you on the next video","The YouTube video, ""Best 3 ETF Portfolio That Is Crushing It! (Proven Strategy)"", champions a simplified, three-ETF investment strategy designed to build wealth and consistently outperform most market participants by avoiding the complexities of stock picking and market timing.

The recommended portfolio consists of:
1.  **SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** The ""growth engine,"" focusing on ""proven winners"" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft), with a 48.35% 3-year return and a low 0.04% expense ratio for ""consistent massive growth.""
2.  **JEQ (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Provides growth from tech giants alongside ""fat monthly dividends"" (10.1% yield, 51.4% 3-year return), offering cash flow and stability.
3.  **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** The ""foundation"" for long-term wealth, tracking the S&P 500 for ""rock-solid stability"" through diversification, yielding a 36.21% 3-year return.

This portfolio's synergy combines SCHG for ""offense"" (growth), JEQ for ""steady income"" (cash flow), and VOO for ""defense"" (stability), with minimal overlap. The video argues this strategy ""crushes 90% of the people trying to beat the market,"" aligning with principles like Warren Buffett's S&P 500 advocacy and leveraging the efficiency of low-expense ETFs. Beyond the ETF selection, the video emphasizes crucial long-term investment principles: viewing market pullbacks as ""opportunities to get rich"" to ""buy more,"" advocating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as the ""single best strategy for regular people"" through consistent, automated investments, and maintaining a patient, long-term perspective by ignoring short-term market fluctuations, as ""the market rewards patience.""",Schwab,0.9,0.9

he keeps it simple you don't so here's the wakeup call if you're losing money it's not because investing is hard it's because you're making it hard stop the strategy works these ETFs work you just need to act if you're tired of losing listen up this video will change how invest you want growth you want to build real wealth chg is how you do itg stand chg stands for the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and this is where the winners live companies like apple Microsoft Amazon and Google the Giants the Unstoppable innovators these aren't cheap penny stocks this is the future here's whyg is so powerful it's simple it focuses on the companies that are already winning and guess what they keep winning let's look at the numbers because the numbers don't lie scg is up 42% year-to date in the last 3 months 15% the expense ratio 0.4% basically it's free to hold compare that to some actively management funds charging you 1% 2% or even more while underperforming you're getting ripped off scg

the cash the scale and the growth you're not betting on potential you're betting on Proven Winners Action step buy chg now don't wait every day you're out of the market you're leaving money on the table if you want growth stop guessing and start winning let's talk about jeq the ETF that pays you to be patient you want growth you want cash flow JQ gives you both here's how it works jeq focuses on Tech the NASDAQ giants like Microsoft Apple and Google but here's the twist it pays you a fat monthly dividend right now that dividend yield is 10.1% let me put that in perspective you put $10,000 into jeq you're collecting over $1,000 a year just in dividends that's real passive income and while you're getting paid your investment is still growing year to date jeq is up 177% and the dividends and the total return this year 27.5 4% but here's the real kicker I'm not just telling you this I'm heavily invested in jeq on December 4th my jeq dividend checks totaled $4 4,426 193 that's over 4 grand in passive income in one month imagine seeing that hit your account now here's why I own jpq along withg and Vu sure I do a lot of aggressive investing I chase big opportunities when I see them but jbq scg and Vu are the foundation of my portfolio why because they work they give me much needed stability and consistent growth while everyone else is panicking these ETFs let me sleep at night most people ignore ETFs like jpq because they think it's boring guess what the boring stuff makes you rich dividends compound growth Stacks jpq does both bottom line jpq is a no-brainer you get Tech growth and massive income stop betting on hype start building real wealth the action step here just buy JQ take the cash reinvest it don't wait every month you sit out you're losing money if you're serious about getting rich you need vo this is the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF and it's the single best investment for building long-term wealth why because Vu tracks the S&amp;P 500 the top 500 companies in America think Apple Microsoft Coca-Cola Google Tesla the Giants the companies that drive the entire economy let me hit you with the numbers year-to dat Vu is up 28.521220 and fail the S&amp;P 500 has delivered consistent returns for decades it's a proven wealth buing machine Warren Buffett himself says if you don't know what you're doing and let's be real you don't just buy the S&amp;P 500 vo is perfect for two reasons one it's safe you're spreading your money across the 500 biggest companies two it's simple no stock picking no timing you buy vo and you hold it that's it most investors screw this up because they think safe mean slow wrong the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 10% annual returns for decades you double your money every 7 years without lifting a finger that's not slow that's Unstoppable the bottom line Vu is the foundation without it your portfolio is weak scg gives you growth jeq gives you cash flow vo gives you rock solid stability your action step buy vo keep buying it every month build your foundation this is how you win here's the problem most investors have portfolios that are all over the place random stocks overlap no plan that's why they lose you don't need 20 stocks you need three ETFs scg jeq and vo because together they're the perfect team for a simple portfolio each one has a role SD is your growth engine it targets large cap companies growing fast Amazon Apple Microsoft the titans of innovation it's like rocket fuel for your money jeq gives you cash cash flow and growth it pays you a 10.1% dividend yield every month while still riding the upside of tech that's rare and vo it's your stability it tracks the S&amp;P 500 and delivers consistent long-term gains with almost no risk think of it like this scg is offense JQ is your steady income and vo is defense together they cover all the bases growth cash flow and stability here's the magic there's very little overlap scg and jeq focus on growth but jpq adds dividends vo balances it all out by spreading risk across the top 500 companies in America you're not Overexposed to any one stock and you're not missing out on growth or income the average investor overthinks they complicate their portfolios and end up losing money you you keep it simple these three ETFs give you everything you need to build massive wealth your action step buy all three split your money evenly automate monthly Investments growth income stability done if you're not doing this you're making it harder than it needs to be stop guessing start compounding most people panic when the market dips they see red freak out and sell everything that's why they stay broke you know what smart investors do they buy here's the truth pullbacks are not the end of the world they're opportunities to get rich stocks don't go up in a straight line and neither do ETFs scg JQ and vo will have pullbacks and when they do you should thank the market why because pullbacks let you buy assets at a discount let's say scg drops 10% if you believe in apple Amazon and Microsoft then it's on sale you wouldn't freak out if your favorite sneakers drop 10% in price you'd buy two pairs this is the same thing the difference between people who get rich and people who lose the rich love pullbacks they buy when everyone else is scared it's that simple one Buffett calls this Being Greedy when others are fearful you don't need a crystal ball to win you just need the guts to buy when the market hands you a deal here's the move for this 3 ETF portfolio stop checking this portfolio every day when scg JQ or vo pull back don't sell Don't Panic buy more add to your position pullbacks are a cheat code for long-term wealth over time the market goes up history proves this if you're not buying during the dips you're sabotaging your future self you're action step when you see red see opportunity buy the dip buy more keep holding that's how wealth is built you will not time the market you think you can you're wrong nobody can consistently Warren Buffett doesn't even try and yet most people sit on the sidelines waiting for the perfect time to invest guess what that perfect time doesn't exist here's the reality if you're not in the market you're losing money inflation is eating your cash the market is moving without you so stop overthinking and start using the single best strategy for regular people dollar cost averaging or DCA here's how it works you pick an amount $100 $500 $1,000 a month and you invest it into scg jeq and vo every single month whether the market is up down or sideways you keep investing it's automatic it's foolproof here's why it works when prices drop you're buying more shares when prices go up the shares you already own are worth with more over time you're guaranteed to get an average price you're not timing the market you're beating it with consistency look at history the market has gone up over time averaging about 10% annual returns if you invest consistently you don't need to worry about short-term dips headlines or crashes DCA removes emotion it removes Panic it removes guesswork and the reason why most people fail they try to time the market get scared during dips or sit out waiting for a miracle you you stick to the plan you invest every month no matter what the action step automate your Investments set up a monthly buy for scg jeq and vo never stop the market rewards patience this is how average people can get rich so here's the deal if you're serious about Building Wealth you need a plan not a theory not a maybe a step-by-step game plan you can follow right now here's exactly what to do buy scg JQ and Vo split your money evenly across all three no second guessing set up the automatic Investments this is dollar cost averaging whether you have a1500 or $10,000 a month to invest just commit to it and then ignore the noise stop checking your portfolio every day stop listening to Market gurus predicting Doom and Gloom focus on the long-term upside and remember scg gives you massive growth from the fastest growing companies in the world jpq pays you cash flow while still riding the upside of te and vo gives you stability it doesn't matter if there's a recession or a boom over time these ETFs will grow your wealth while everyone else panics guesses and loses here's the reality today I've handed you a 3 ETF portfolio that anyone can use to get rich but if you're the type of person who really wants to step up your game who wants to move faster get sharper insights and take investing to the next level then join my patreon inside I give you realtime trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market this isn't Theory these are actionable moves you can use to stay ahead of the curve if you're ready to level up and stop guessing join the patreon the Link's in the description stop waiting and start Building Wealth peace and I'll see you on the next video","The YouTube video, ""Best 3 ETF Portfolio That Is Crushing It! (Proven Strategy)"", champions a simplified, three-ETF investment strategy designed to build wealth and consistently outperform most market participants by avoiding the complexities of stock picking and market timing.

The recommended portfolio consists of:
1.  **SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** The ""growth engine,"" focusing on ""proven winners"" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft), with a 48.35% 3-year return and a low 0.04% expense ratio for ""consistent massive growth.""
2.  **JEQ (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Provides growth from tech giants alongside ""fat monthly dividends"" (10.1% yield, 51.4% 3-year return), offering cash flow and stability.
3.  **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** The ""foundation"" for long-term wealth, tracking the S&P 500 for ""rock-solid stability"" through diversification, yielding a 36.21% 3-year return.

This portfolio's synergy combines SCHG for ""offense"" (growth), JEQ for ""steady income"" (cash flow), and VOO for ""defense"" (stability), with minimal overlap. The video argues this strategy ""crushes 90% of the people trying to beat the market,"" aligning with principles like Warren Buffett's S&P 500 advocacy and leveraging the efficiency of low-expense ETFs. Beyond the ETF selection, the video emphasizes crucial long-term investment principles: viewing market pullbacks as ""opportunities to get rich"" to ""buy more,"" advocating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as the ""single best strategy for regular people"" through consistent, automated investments, and maintaining a patient, long-term perspective by ignoring short-term market fluctuations, as ""the market rewards patience.""",Vanguard,0.9,0.9

grand in passive income in one month imagine seeing that hit your account now here's why I own jpq along withg and Vu sure I do a lot of aggressive investing I chase big opportunities when I see them

serious about getting rich you need vo this is the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF and it's the single best investment for building long-term wealth why because Vu tracks the S&amp;P 500 the top 500

S&amp;P 500 vo is perfect for two reasons one it's safe you're spreading your money across the 500 biggest companies two it's simple no stock picking no timing you buy vo and you hold it that's it most investors screw this up because they think safe mean slow wrong the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 10% annual returns for decades you double your money every 7 years without lifting a finger that's not slow that's Unstoppable the bottom line Vu is the foundation without it your portfolio is weak scg gives you growth jeq gives you cash flow vo gives you rock solid stability your action step buy vo keep buying it every month build your foundation this is how you win here's the problem most investors have portfolios that are all over the place random stocks overlap no plan that's why they lose you don't need 20 stocks you need three ETFs scg jeq and vo because together they're the perfect team for a simple portfolio each one has a role SD is your growth engine it targets large cap companies

steady income and vo is defense together they cover all the bases growth cash flow and stability here's the magic there's very little overlap scg and jeq focus on growth but jpq adds dividends vo balances it all out by spreading risk across the top 500 companies in America you're not Overexposed to any one stock and you're not missing out on growth or income the average investor overthinks they complicate their portfolios and end up losing money you you keep it simple these three ETFs give you everything you need to build massive wealth your action step buy all three split your money evenly automate monthly Investments growth income stability done if you're not doing this you're making it harder than it needs to be stop guessing start compounding most people panic when the market dips they see red freak out and sell everything that's why they stay broke you know what smart investors do they buy here's the truth pullbacks are not the end of the world they're opportunities to get rich stocks don't go up in a straight line and neither do ETFs scg JQ and vo will have pullbacks and when they do you should thank the market why because pullbacks let you buy assets at a discount let's say scg drops 10% if you believe in apple Amazon and Microsoft then it's on sale you wouldn't freak out if your favorite sneakers drop 10% in price you'd buy two pairs this is the same thing the difference between people who get rich and people who lose the rich love pullbacks they buy when everyone else is scared it's that simple one Buffett calls this Being Greedy when others are fearful you don't need a crystal ball to win you just need the guts to buy when the market hands you a deal here's the move for this 3 ETF portfolio stop checking this portfolio every day when scg JQ or vo pull back don't sell Don't Panic buy more add to your position pullbacks are a cheat code for long-term wealth over time the market goes up history proves this if you're not buying during the dips

you're wrong nobody can consistently Warren Buffett doesn't even try and yet most people sit on the sidelines waiting for the perfect time to invest guess what that perfect time doesn't exist here's the reality if you're not in the market you're losing money inflation is eating your cash the market is moving without you so stop overthinking and start using the single best strategy for regular people dollar cost averaging or DCA here's how it works you pick an amount $100 $500 $1,000 a month and you invest it into scg jeq and vo every single month whether the market is up down or sideways you keep investing it's automatic it's foolproof here's why it works when prices drop you're buying more shares when prices go up the shares you already own are worth with more over time you're guaranteed to get an average price you're not timing the market you're beating it with consistency look at history the market has gone up over time averaging about 10% annual returns if you invest consistently you don't need to worry about short-term dips headlines or crashes DCA removes emotion it removes Panic it removes guesswork and the reason why most people fail they try to time the market get scared during dips or sit out waiting for a miracle you you stick to the plan you invest every month no matter what the action step automate your Investments set up a monthly buy for scg jeq and vo never stop the market rewards patience this is how average people can get rich so here's the deal if you're serious about Building Wealth you need a plan not a theory not a maybe a

cost averaging whether you have a1500 or $10,000 a month to invest just commit to it and then ignore the noise stop checking your portfolio every day stop listening to Market gurus predicting Doom and Gloom focus on the long-term upside and remember scg gives you massive growth from the fastest growing companies in the world jpq pays you cash flow while still riding the upside of te and vo gives you stability it doesn't matter if there's a recession or a boom over time these ETFs will grow your wealth while everyone else panics guesses and loses here's the reality today I've handed you a 3

curve if you're ready to level up and stop guessing join the patreon the Link's in the description stop waiting and start Building Wealth peace and I'll see you on the next video","The YouTube video, ""Best 3 ETF Portfolio That Is Crushing It! (Proven Strategy)"", champions a simplified, three-ETF investment strategy designed to build wealth and consistently outperform most market participants by avoiding the complexities of stock picking and market timing.

The recommended portfolio consists of:
1.  **SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** The ""growth engine,"" focusing on ""proven winners"" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft), with a 48.35% 3-year return and a low 0.04% expense ratio for ""consistent massive growth.""
2.  **JEQ (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Provides growth from tech giants alongside ""fat monthly dividends"" (10.1% yield, 51.4% 3-year return), offering cash flow and stability.
3.  **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** The ""foundation"" for long-term wealth, tracking the S&P 500 for ""rock-solid stability"" through diversification, yielding a 36.21% 3-year return.

This portfolio's synergy combines SCHG for ""offense"" (growth), JEQ for ""steady income"" (cash flow), and VOO for ""defense"" (stability), with minimal overlap. The video argues this strategy ""crushes 90% of the people trying to beat the market,"" aligning with principles like Warren Buffett's S&P 500 advocacy and leveraging the efficiency of low-expense ETFs. Beyond the ETF selection, the video emphasizes crucial long-term investment principles: viewing market pullbacks as ""opportunities to get rich"" to ""buy more,"" advocating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as the ""single best strategy for regular people"" through consistent, automated investments, and maintaining a patient, long-term perspective by ignoring short-term market fluctuations, as ""the market rewards patience.""",Microsoft,1.0,0.9

""Best 3 ETF Portfolio That Is Crushing It! (Proven Strategy)"", champions a simplified, three-ETF investment strategy designed to build wealth and consistently outperform most market participants by avoiding the complexities of stock picking and market timing.

The recommended portfolio consists of:
1.  **SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** The ""growth engine,"" focusing on ""proven winners"" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft), with a 48.35% 3-year return and a low 0.04% expense ratio for ""consistent massive growth.""
2.  **JEQ (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Provides growth from tech giants alongside ""fat monthly dividends"" (10.1% yield, 51.4% 3-year return), offering cash flow and stability.
3.  **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** The ""foundation"" for long-term wealth, tracking the S&P 500 for ""rock-solid stability"" through diversification, yielding a 36.21% 3-year return.

This portfolio's synergy combines SCHG for ""offense"" (growth), JEQ for ""steady income"" (cash flow), and VOO for ""defense"" (stability), with minimal overlap. The video argues this strategy ""crushes 90% of the people trying to beat the market,"" aligning with principles like Warren Buffett's S&P 500 advocacy and leveraging the efficiency of low-expense ETFs. Beyond the ETF selection, the video emphasizes crucial long-term investment principles: viewing market pullbacks as ""opportunities to get rich"" to ""buy more,"" advocating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as the ""single best strategy for regular people"" through consistent, automated investments, and maintaining a patient, long-term perspective by ignoring short-term market fluctuations, as ""the market rewards patience.""",Google,1.0,0.9

curve if you're ready to level up and stop guessing join the patreon the Link's in the description stop waiting and start Building Wealth peace and I'll see you on the next video","The YouTube video, ""Best 3 ETF Portfolio That Is Crushing It! (Proven Strategy)"", champions a simplified, three-ETF investment strategy designed to build wealth and consistently outperform most market participants by avoiding the complexities of stock picking and market timing.

The recommended portfolio consists of:
1.  **SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF):** The ""growth engine,"" focusing on ""proven winners"" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft), with a 48.35% 3-year return and a low 0.04% expense ratio for ""consistent massive growth.""
2.  **JEQ (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF):** Provides growth from tech giants alongside ""fat monthly dividends"" (10.1% yield, 51.4% 3-year return), offering cash flow and stability.
3.  **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** The ""foundation"" for long-term wealth, tracking the S&P 500 for ""rock-solid stability"" through diversification, yielding a 36.21% 3-year return.

This portfolio's synergy combines SCHG for ""offense"" (growth), JEQ for ""steady income"" (cash flow), and VOO for ""defense"" (stability), with minimal overlap. The video argues this strategy ""crushes 90% of the people trying to beat the market,"" aligning with principles like Warren Buffett's S&P 500 advocacy and leveraging the efficiency of low-expense ETFs. Beyond the ETF selection, the video emphasizes crucial long-term investment principles: viewing market pullbacks as ""opportunities to get rich"" to ""buy more,"" advocating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as the ""single best strategy for regular people"" through consistent, automated investments, and maintaining a patient, long-term perspective by ignoring short-term market fluctuations, as ""the market rewards patience.""",Tesla,1.0,0.8

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en let me cut straight to the point if you're serious about growing your portfolio and you're looking for consistent income or capital appreciation these three ETFs are the ones to beat jeq jei and SD now I'm going to show you why picking the right one could mean the difference between growing your wealth or getting stuck in the mud while the market leaves you behind these aren't just your run-of-the-mill funds they're designed for investors who want strong returns without the high risks you need to know which one fits you so stick with me and by the end of this video you'll know exactly which one will give you the best shot at hitting your financial goals let's get brutally honest for a second the reason most Americans are broke isn't because they aren't earning enough it's because they're compounding bad financial decisions you've heard this before but it's time to really listen every time you buy that $5 Starbucks Coffee lease a brand new car you can't afford or eat out for lunch every day you're robbing your future self you're not just losing the $5 you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow and work for you for the next 20 30 or 40 years here's the math let's say you blow $500 a month on things you don't need that's $66,000 a year now invest that $6,000 at a 7% return reinvest the dividends and over 30 years you could have over $600,000 sitting in your portfolio but no you chose instant gratification over long-term wealth it's really easy to become a millionaire with a solid investment plan and time on your side but most people would rather indulge in the fleeting pleasure of a Starbucks latte then set themselves up for Financial Freedom and then they wonder why they're living paycheck to paycheck most Americans could easily save an extra $300 to $500 a month you just have to stop being lazy and start cutting out the wasteful spending if you're serious about investing that money could be buying assets that pay you dividends dividends that when reinvested create the Snowball Effect that builds true wealth but here's the cold hard reality if you don't wake up now you're setting yourself up for a future where you're 65 years old still grinding away at a part-time job asking people do you want fries with that you think I'm being harsh good because the truth hurts if you don't take investing seriously today you'll end up stuck in the rat race forever it's not because you didn't make enough money it's because you didn't take control of what you had your future is in your hands right now all right let's get into what these ETFs are all about you've got three strong contenders here each with different strategies returns and risk levels jeq this one's packing a yield of 12.42% that's not a typo 12.42% it's no secret why people love it but don't get lured in just yet there's more to the story jepi a little more conservative than JQ 8% yield and it's built to deliver solid income while keeping things stable SCD this ETF is the Workhorse 3.63% yield but what you're really getting here is reliability low fees and steady growth it's the turtle to jq's Rabbit the expense ratios jeq charges 35% JPI is also 35% and SCD comes in super low at .6% but here's the kicker expense ratios aren't the full story what matters is what you keep more on that in just a bit let's talk about jq's yield because 12.42% catches everyone's attention right the secret sauce here is the covered call strategy in simple terms they're selling options on the tech stocks they hold this means they're taking in premiums which they pass on to you as dividend income now that sounds amazing for generating cash flow but there's a downside you're capping your upside potential in a market where tech stocks are exploding you could miss out on the full gains because you've sold off some of your rights to profit so if you're in it for the yield and don't mind giving up the big win on those growth stocks jpq is your guy but if you're all about the upside and want to see those Tech stocks fly you might not love it when jpq hits a ceiling while the rest of the sector takes off now here's where most people make a huge mistake they get obsessed with the expense ratios yes fees matters but they're not the whole story what you should be focusing on is net return what you're making after the fees think about this jeq charges. 35% while SD charges just .6% seems like a no-brainer to go with SD right not so fast look at the yield 12.42% versus 3.63% that difference more than makes up for the higher fee if you're chasing income and don't fall into the Trap of being Pennywise and dollar foolish the real question is how much is your portfolio growing or paying you after all the dust settles focus on that not just those fees now let's talk about results because that's what really counts over the last 3 years jeq is up 39.663741 % SCD 23.08% and the S&amp;P 500 up 30.9 7% jpq is the only one here that has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past 3 years if you're looking for the ETF that's given the highest returns there's your answer but and this is critical High Returns come with higher risk jpq is more volatile because it's loaded with tech so while it's leading the pack you need to ask yourself if you're comfortable with the roller coaster so who are these ETFs really for let's break it down jeq you're aggressive you're not afraid of risk and you want that high yield you can handle volatility because you're chasing growth and income perfect for those with a longer time horizon or who have other stable Investments balancing the risk jepi you want income but you're more conservative maybe you're in or approaching retirement and you need steady payouts without the market drama jepi is your play and then there's SCD you're here for the long-term stability low fees consistent growth and a solid yield you're not looking to get rich quick you're playing the long game knowing where you fit on the risk Spectrum will point you toward the right ETF for you and one of the biggest mistakes investors make chasing yield blindly it's easy to get hypnotized by numbers like 12.42% but if you don't understand the risk behind that yield you're setting up yourself for failure jq's high yield is tied to a high-risk High reward strategy you're not just getting easy money you're taking on volatility same with JPI it's built for income but don't expect explosive growth if you're chasing yield without understanding why the yield is high you're playing a dangerous game always balance the potential income with the underlying risks finally let's talk strategy if you're investing regularly you've probably heard of dollar cost averaging or DCA spreading your Investments over time to smooth out the highs and lows of the market in volatile markets DCA is a solid approach because it removes the guesswork of timing you you don't have to pick the perfect entry point you just keep investing no matter what the market is doing over time that strategy wins because time in the market beats timing the market but what if you've got a large sum of money research shows that lumpsum investing often outperforms DCA because the market tends to go up over time it's riskier but it can pay off if you're betting that the market will rise the bottom line pick a strategy and stick to it the worst thing you can do is jump in and out based on emotion and I really hope you understand that I make these videos for two reasons first because they actually help you get rich that's the mission here I don't make a single sponsorship dollar from any of these ETFs I really wish I did but I don't I'm doing this because the strategies work and I believe in them second these videos help me make better decisions with my own money I'm not just talking Theory I've got skin in the game I own both SD and JQ with over $200,000 in JQ alone why because it fits my aggressive investing style and I can handle the volum ility I'm not here just giving advice I'm doing exactly what I tell you to do and unlike most people in this space I'm not hiding behind charts I put my money where my mouth is and if you follow along you can do the same so if you've got ideas for future videos or want to see more drop them in the comments I'm here to make content that actually helps you all right here's the final verdict as I see it jpq best for aggressive investors who want high yield and can handle the volatility JPI is best for income focused investors who want stability and consistent payouts andd is best for long-term investors looking for growth with low risk and low fees the best ETF for you is the one that fits your goals stop chasing the latest Trend focus on your strategy and you'll always be ahead of the game now if you're serious about leveling up your Investments if you actually want to start playing at a higher level join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market here's the kicker every day you wait you're leaving money on the table so stop watching from the sidelines jump in because I've got strategies coming That Could set you up for Life the Link's in the description and I'll see you on the inside peace","This video provides a financial analysis recommending three distinct dividend ETFs—JEQ, JEPI, and SCHD—as options for portfolio growth and consistent income. The core insight is that the optimal choice depends entirely on an investor's individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

Here's a breakdown of the ETF recommendations:

*   **JEQ (12.42% yield, 0.35% expense, +39.66% over 3 years):** Recommended for **aggressive investors** seeking high dividend income from a tech-focused covered call strategy. While outperforming the S&P 500, it carries significant volatility and potentially capped upside in strong bull markets.
*   **JEPI (8% yield, 0.35% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Best suited for **conservative, income-focused investors**, particularly those nearing or in retirement, who prioritize stable, less volatile payouts.
*   **SCHD (3.63% yield, 0.06% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Described as a reliable ""workhorse"" for **long-term investors** looking for stability, consistent growth, and low fees.

Beyond specific ETF picks, the speaker delivers a strong message on personal finance: financial struggles often stem not from insufficient earnings, but from ""compounding bad financial decisions""—small, daily discretionary purchases that collectively forfeit significant potential wealth (e.g., $600,000+ over 30 years from $500/month invested).

one's packing a yield of 12.42% that's not a typo 12.42% it's no secret why people love it but don't get lured in just yet there's more to the story jepi a little more conservative than JQ 8% yield

on that in just a bit let's talk about jq's yield because 12.42% catches everyone's attention right the secret sauce here is the covered call strategy in simple terms they're selling options on the tech stocks they hold this means they're taking in premiums which they pass on to you as dividend income now that sounds amazing for generating cash flow but there's a downside you're capping your upside potential in a market where tech stocks are exploding you could miss out on the full gains because you've sold off some of your rights to profit so if you're in it for the yield and don't mind giving up the big win on those growth stocks jpq is your guy but if you're all about the upside and want to see those Tech stocks fly you might not love it when jpq hits a ceiling while the rest of the sector takes off now here's where most people make a huge mistake they get obsessed with the expense ratios yes fees matters but they're not the whole story what you should be focusing on is net return what you're making after the fees think about this jeq charges. 35% while SD charges just .6% seems like a no-brainer to go with SD right not so fast look at the yield 12.42% versus 3.63% that difference more than makes up for the higher fee if you're chasing income and don't fall into the Trap of being Pennywise and dollar foolish the real question is how much is your portfolio growing or paying you after all the dust settles focus on that not just those fees now let's talk about results because that's what really counts over the last 3 years jeq is up 39.663741 % SCD 23.08% and the S&amp;P 500 up 30.9 7% jpq is the only one here that has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past 3 years if you're looking for the ETF that's given the highest returns there's your answer but and this is critical High Returns come with higher risk jpq is more volatile because it's loaded with tech so while it's leading the pack you need to ask yourself if you're comfortable with the roller coaster so who are these ETFs really for let's break it down jeq you're aggressive you're not afraid of risk and you want that high yield you can handle volatility because you're chasing growth and income perfect for those with a longer time horizon or who have other stable Investments balancing the risk jepi you want income but you're more conservative maybe you're in or approaching retirement and you need steady payouts without the market drama jepi is your play and then there's SCD you're here for the long-term stability low fees consistent growth and a solid yield you're not looking to get rich quick you're playing the long game knowing where you fit on the risk Spectrum will point you toward the right ETF for you and one of the biggest mistakes investors make chasing yield blindly it's easy to get hypnotized by numbers like 12.42% but if you don't understand the risk behind that yield you're setting up yourself for failure jq's high yield is tied to a high-risk High reward strategy you're not just getting easy money you're taking on volatility same with JPI it's built for income but don't expect explosive growth if you're chasing yield without understanding why the yield is high you're playing a dangerous game always balance the potential income with the underlying risks finally let's talk strategy if you're investing regularly you've probably heard of dollar cost averaging or DCA spreading your Investments over time to smooth out the highs and lows of the market in volatile markets DCA is a solid approach because it removes the guesswork of timing you you don't have to pick the perfect entry point you just keep investing no matter what the market is doing over time that strategy wins because time in the market beats timing the market but what if you've got a large sum of money research shows that lumpsum investing often outperforms DCA because the market tends to go up over time it's riskier but it can pay off if you're betting that the market will rise the bottom line pick a strategy and stick to it the worst thing you can do is jump in and out based on emotion and I really hope you understand that I make these videos for two reasons first because they actually help you get rich that's the mission here I don't make a single sponsorship dollar from any of these ETFs I really wish I did but I don't I'm doing this because the strategies work and I believe in them second these videos help me make better decisions with my own money I'm not just talking Theory I've got skin in the game I own both SD and JQ with over $200,000 in JQ alone why because it fits my aggressive investing style and I can handle the volum ility I'm not here just giving advice I'm doing exactly what I tell you to do and unlike most people in this space I'm not hiding behind charts I put my money where my mouth is and if you follow along you can do the same so if you've got ideas for future videos or want to see more drop them in the comments I'm here to make content that actually helps you all right here's the final verdict as I see it jpq best for aggressive investors who want high yield and can handle the volatility JPI is best for income focused investors who want stability and consistent payouts andd is best for long-term investors looking for growth with low risk and low fees the best ETF for you is the one that fits your goals stop chasing

patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the market here's the kicker every day you wait you're leaving money on the table so stop watching from the sidelines jump in because I've got strategies coming That Could set you up for Life the Link's in the description and I'll see you on the inside peace","This video provides a financial analysis recommending three distinct dividend ETFs—JEQ, JEPI, and SCHD—as options for portfolio growth and consistent income. The core insight is that the optimal choice depends entirely on an investor's individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

Here's a breakdown of the ETF recommendations:

*   **JEQ (12.42% yield, 0.35% expense, +39.66% over 3 years):** Recommended for **aggressive investors** seeking high dividend income from a tech-focused covered call strategy. While outperforming the S&P 500, it carries significant volatility and potentially capped upside in strong bull markets.
*   **JEPI (8% yield, 0.35% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Best suited for **conservative, income-focused investors**, particularly those nearing or in retirement, who prioritize stable, less volatile payouts.
*   **SCHD (3.63% yield, 0.06% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Described as a reliable ""workhorse"" for **long-term investors** looking for stability, consistent growth, and low fees.

Beyond specific ETF picks, the speaker delivers a strong message on personal finance: financial struggles often stem not from insufficient earnings, but from ""compounding bad financial decisions""—small, daily discretionary purchases that collectively forfeit significant potential wealth (e.g., $600,000+ over 30 years from $500/month invested). Viewers are urged to cut wasteful spending and invest in dividend-paying assets.

Key investor warnings include:
1.  **Avoiding blindly chasing high yields:** Understand the underlying risks (e.g., JEQ's volatility and capped upside).
2.  **Focusing on ""net return"":** Overall return after fees is more critical than just low expense ratios.
3.  **Sticking to a consistent strategy:** ""Time in the market beats timing the market,"" emphasizing dollar-cost averaging over emotional trading.

The speaker personally invests in both SCHD and JEQ (with over $200,000 in JEQ), demonstrating conviction in these recommendations.",jepi,0.9,0.7

this is critical High Returns come with higher risk jpq is more volatile because it's loaded with tech so while it's leading the pack you need to ask yourself if you're comfortable with the roller coaster so who are these ETFs really for let's break it down jeq you're aggressive you're not afraid of risk and you want that high yield you can handle volatility because you're chasing growth and income perfect for those with a longer time horizon or who have other stable Investments balancing the risk jepi you want income but you're more conservative maybe you're in or approaching retirement and you need steady payouts without the market drama jepi is your play and then there's SCD you're here for the long-term stability low fees consistent growth and a solid yield you're not looking to get rich quick you're playing the long game knowing where you fit on the risk Spectrum will point you toward the right ETF for you and one of the biggest mistakes investors make chasing yield blindly it's easy to get hypnotized by numbers like 12.42% but if you don't understand the risk behind that yield you're setting up yourself for failure jq's high yield is tied to a high-risk High reward strategy you're not just getting easy money you're taking on volatility same with JPI it's built for income but don't expect explosive growth if you're chasing yield without understanding why the yield is high you're playing a dangerous game always balance the potential income with the underlying risks finally let's talk strategy if you're investing regularly you've probably heard of dollar cost averaging or DCA spreading your Investments over time to smooth out the highs and lows of the market in volatile markets DCA is a solid approach because it removes the guesswork of timing you you don't have to pick the perfect entry point you just keep investing no matter what the market is doing over time that strategy wins because time in the market beats timing the market but what if you've got a large sum of money research shows that lumpsum investing often outperforms DCA because the market tends to go up over time it's riskier but it can pay off if you're betting that the market will rise the bottom line pick a strategy and stick to it the worst thing you can do is jump in and out based on emotion and I really hope you understand that I make these videos for two reasons first because they actually help you get rich that's the mission here I don't make a single sponsorship dollar from any of these ETFs I really wish I did but I don't I'm doing this because the strategies work and I believe in them second these videos help me make better decisions with my own money I'm not just talking Theory I've got skin in the game I own both SD and JQ with over $200,000 in JQ alone why because it fits my aggressive investing style and I can handle the volum ility I'm not here just giving advice I'm doing exactly what I tell you to do and unlike most people in this space I'm not hiding behind charts I put my money where my mouth is and if you follow along you can do the same so if you've got ideas for future videos or want to see more drop them in the comments I'm here to make content that actually helps you all right here's the final verdict as I see it jpq best for aggressive investors who want high yield and can handle the volatility JPI is best for income focused investors who want stability and consistent payouts andd is best for long-term investors looking for growth with low risk and low fees the best ETF for you is the one that fits your goals stop chasing

sidelines jump in because I've got strategies coming That Could set you up for Life the Link's in the description and I'll see you on the inside peace","This video provides a financial analysis recommending three distinct dividend ETFs—JEQ, JEPI, and SCHD—as options for portfolio growth and consistent income. The core insight is that the optimal choice depends entirely on an investor's individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

Here's a breakdown of the ETF recommendations:

*   **JEQ (12.42% yield, 0.35% expense, +39.66% over 3 years):** Recommended for **aggressive investors** seeking high dividend income from a tech-focused covered call strategy. While outperforming the S&P 500, it carries significant volatility and potentially capped upside in strong bull markets.
*   **JEPI (8% yield, 0.35% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Best suited for **conservative, income-focused investors**, particularly those nearing or in retirement, who prioritize stable, less volatile payouts.
*   **SCHD (3.63% yield, 0.06% expense, +23.08% over 3 years):** Described as a reliable ""workhorse"" for **long-term investors** looking for stability, consistent growth, and low fees.

Beyond specific ETF picks, the speaker delivers a strong message on personal finance: financial struggles often stem not from insufficient earnings, but from ""compounding bad financial decisions""—small, daily discretionary purchases that collectively forfeit significant potential wealth (e.g., $600,000+ over 30 years from $500/month invested). Viewers are urged to cut wasteful spending and invest in dividend-paying assets.

Key investor warnings include:
1.  **Avoiding blindly chasing high yields:** Understand the underlying risks (e.g., JEQ's volatility and capped upside).
2.  **Focusing on ""net return"":** Overall return after fees is more critical than just low expense ratios.
3.  **Sticking to a consistent strategy:** ""Time in the market beats timing the market,"" emphasizing dollar-cost averaging over emotional trading.

The speaker personally invests in both SCHD and JEQ (with over $200,000 in JEQ), demonstrating conviction in these recommendations.",Starbucks,1.0,-0.9

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en let me cut straight to the point if you're serious about growing your portfolio and you're looking for consistent income or capital appreciation these three ETFs are the ones to beat jeq jei and SD now I'm going to show you why picking the right one could mean the difference between growing your wealth or getting stuck in the mud while the market leaves you behind these aren't just your run-of-the-mill funds they're designed for investors who want strong returns without the high risks you need to know which one fits you so stick with me and by the end of this video you'll know exactly which one will give you the best shot at hitting your financial goals let's get brutally honest for a second the reason most Americans are broke isn't because they aren't earning enough it's because they're compounding bad financial decisions you've heard this before but it's time to really listen every time you buy that $5 Starbucks Coffee lease a brand new car you can't afford or eat out for lunch every day you're robbing your future self you're not just losing the $5 you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow and work for you for the next 20 30 or 40 years here's the math let's say you blow $500 a month on things you don't need that's $66,000 a year now invest that $6,000 at a 7% return reinvest the dividends and over 30 years you could have over $600,000 sitting in your portfolio but no you chose instant gratification over long-term wealth it's really easy to become a millionaire with a solid investment plan and time on your side but most people would rather indulge in the fleeting pleasure of a Starbucks latte then set themselves up for Financial Freedom and then they wonder why they're living paycheck to paycheck most Americans could easily save an extra $300 to $500 a month you just have to stop being lazy and start cutting out the wasteful spending if you're serious about investing that money could be buying assets that pay you dividends dividends that when reinvested create the Snowball Effect that builds true wealth but here's the cold hard reality if you don't wake up now you're setting yourself up for a future where you're 65 years old still grinding away at a part-time job asking people do you want fries with that you think I'm being harsh good because the truth hurts if you don't take investing seriously today you'll end up stuck in the rat race forever it's not because you didn't make enough money it's because you didn't take control of what you had your future is in your hands right now all right let's get into what these ETFs are all about you've got three strong contenders here each with different strategies returns and risk levels jeq this one's packing a yield of 12.42% that's not a typo 12.42% it's no secret why people love it but don't get lured in just yet there's more to the story jepi a little more conservative than JQ 8% yield and it's built to deliver solid income while keeping things stable SCD this ETF is the Workhorse 3.63% yield but what you're really getting here is reliability low fees and steady growth it's the turtle to jq's Rabbit the expense ratios jeq charges 35% JPI is also 35% and SCD comes in super low at .6% but here's the kicker expense ratios aren't the full story what matters is what you keep more on that in just a bit let's talk about jq's yield because 12.42% catches everyone's attention right the secret sauce here is the covered call strategy in simple terms they're selling options on the tech stocks they hold this means they're taking in premiums which they pass on to you as dividend income now that sounds amazing for generating cash flow but there's a downside you're capping your upside potential in a market where tech stocks are exploding you could miss out on the full gains because you've sold off some of your rights to profit so if you're in it for the yield and don't mind giving up the big win on those growth stocks jpq is your guy but if you're all about the upside and want to see those Tech stocks fly you might not love it when jpq hits a ceiling while the rest of the sector takes off now here's where most people make a huge mistake they get obsessed with the expense ratios yes fees matters but they're not the whole story what you should be focusing on is net return what you're making after the fees think about this jeq charges. 35% while SD charges just .6% seems like a no-brainer to go with SD right not so fast look at the yield 12.42% versus 3.63% that difference more than makes up for the higher fee if you're chasing income and don't fall into the Trap of being Pennywise and dollar foolish the real question is how much is your portfolio growing or paying you after all the dust settles focus on that not just those fees now let's talk about results because that's what really counts over the last 3 years jeq is up 39.663741 % SCD 23.08% and the

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en let me make something clear you're either getting paid while you sleep or you're working until you die most people choose the second option whether they realize it or not so ask yourself do you want to keep running in place or do you want to build a machine that pays you while you do nothing because that's what jeq does it's paying me every month over $2,100 and I'm not doing a damn thing to earn it want to know how keep watching here's the truth most people invest like amateurs they're buying stocks crossing their fingers and hoping picked a winner it's a guessing game and guess what they lose JQ it's not a guessing game it's predictable the thing has been around for over two years now and it's paying out a 12.46% 30-day SEC yield that's real money every single month and the 12-month rolling dividend yield is 10.02% while everyone else is sitting around hoping their stock jumps 5% next year I'm getting paid right now it's up 9.68% this year and it's focused on big Tech but here's what makes it different it's not just about the stock going up it's about the monthly cash flow you see you're not waiting for the market to decide your fate jeq pays you every month no matter what's happening out there and that's the difference between people who are hoping to get rich and people who are already getting paid let me put it this way last month I added well over $100,000 into jpq why because it pays me every single month and because interest rates are coming down in in the money market fund where I had the cash parked so I was seeking higher returns for that money the beauty is I don't need to wait for some big Market Rally or play the long game hoping my stock hits no I'm getting cash every 30 days I now own 44.7 one shares of JQ and this month they paid me $2,111 in dividends let me say that again $2,111 that's money in my pocket money that I didn't have to work for and the best part I get it next month too you see JQ pays monthly dividends most of the other ETFs make you wait quarterly or Worse annually but with jeq you get paid now so whether you need to cover your rent your living expenses or reinvested to grow even faster it's happening every single month this isn't Theory it's reality I could easily be living off these dividends and you could be too now let's cut the BS here's how jpq makes you money it holds tech stocks and sells covered calls on them what does that mean it means it's renting out its stock positions to other investors and it gets paid a premium for it that premium it gets sent to you in the form of dividends every month this isn't a gamble this is a calculated strategy jpq knows it's not trying to hit home runs with capital gains it's playing smart steady income month after month that's why the Dividends are so high they're selling the potential upside to someone else but they're locking in real income for you every single single month no questions asked sure you give up a bit of the potential growth in exchange for that consistent cash flow but are you really here to chase lottery tickets or are you here to get paid jeq plays it smart and that's why it's paying me every single month While most people are hoping their stock doesn't crash let's talk numbers because most people don't get this the S&amp;P 500 it's fine you'll get 1.5 to 2% yield if you're lucky but that's nothing if you're trying to live off dividends you'll need Millions but that's nothing if you're trying to live off dividends you'll need Millions invested just to make it work and even then you're barely scraping buy meanwhile jpq is currently paying out over 12% let me put that in perspective if you've got 100,000 in the S&amp;P 500 you're making $1,500 a year with JQ you're making over 12,000 that's eight times the income and it's not just about the yield JQ is Tech heavy and over the last few years it's outperforming the S&amp;P 500 so while everyone else is waiting for their growth stocks to take off your cashing checks every single month let's talk specifics I now own 404 shares of jpq and that's worth about $218,000 this month those shares paid me $2,111 that's money I didn't have to work for it just shows up month after month now I didn't start with $218,000 I started with a few thousand bucks and built it up over time but the point is I'm not relying on on some speculative stock to hit it big I'm getting paid every month and I'm using that money to keep building it's a machine the best part you can start today and here's how you really build wealth by reinvesting those dividends let me show you what I do last month I made $2,111 from JQ the current price is around $54 a share so I'm taking that cash and buying roughly 39 more shares those 39 Shares are going to pay me next month and then I'll buy even more shares you see how this works every month I'm adding more shares and every month I'm getting paid more it's compounding it's called The Snowball Effect and here's the kicker every time you reinvest your money Works harder for you instead of just sitting in a bank account doing nothing it's growing and multiplying the more shares I have the bigger the dividend payouts that's how you build real wealth and that's how you set yourself up to retire on just dividends I know what you're thinking I don't have $218,000 to drop into an ETF well guess what neither did I when I started I was 22 years old just out of the Marine Corps with a few thousand bucks and I had to grind my way here but here's the thing it's not about how much you have right now it's about starting even if you've only got $500 or $1,000 you can get in the game the key is to start and if you're sitting on equity in your house why not downsize free up that capital and put it to work you can keep sitting on your house and hoping it appreciates or you can take control of your financial future right now the choice is yours don't sit on the sidelines while your money sits idle and here's the deal the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago the second best time right now so stop making excuses get off your ass and start investing I started with nothing I was a broke 22-year-old just out of the Marine Corps but I worked my ass off made smart Investments and now I'm 54 living the life I always wanted and you can do it too but you have to start now there's no secret formula there's no shortcut it's just about starting staying consistent and making your money work for you so don't wait for the perfect time start today look here's the deal I've got strategies that could retire me today if I want it but I'm not stopping why because I love this game I love Building Wealth and I love helping others do the same that's why I'm still here sharing these moves with you now if you're serious about leveling up your Investments if you actually want to start playing at a higher level join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my taunt plays and daily breakdowns of what's hot in the Market here's the kicker every day you wait you're leaving money on the table so stop watching from the sidelines jump in because I've got strategies coming That Could set you up for Life the Link's in the description and I'll see you on the inside","A financial analyst strongly advocates for JEPQ as a superior investment vehicle for generating consistent, high-yield passive income, enabling investors to potentially retire solely on dividends. JEPQ is presented as a ""simple path to wealth,"" offering impressive monthly payouts (e.g., 12.46% 30-day SEC yield, 10.02% 12-month rolling yield) by holding tech stocks and selling covered calls to prioritize steady income over capital gains. The speaker contrasts this with traditional investing, which is dismissed as an ""amateur guessing game"" reliant on uncertain appreciation, emphasizing JEPQ's immediate and substantial income potential from smaller investments compared to the S&P 500's significantly lower yield. The compounding effect of reinvesting monthly dividends is highlighted as a key benefit, accelerating wealth accumulation, and investors are encouraged to start with any amount.",JEPQ,0.95,0.9

your living expenses or reinvested to grow even faster it's happening every single month this isn't Theory it's reality I could easily be living off these dividends and you could be too now let's cut the BS here's how jpq makes you money it holds tech stocks and sells covered calls on them what does that mean it means it's renting out its stock positions to other investors and it gets paid a premium for it that premium it gets sent to you in the form of dividends every month this isn't a gamble this is a calculated strategy jpq knows it's not trying to hit home runs with capital gains it's playing smart steady income month after month that's why the Dividends are so high they're selling the potential upside to someone else but they're locking in real income for you every single single month no questions asked sure you give up a bit of the potential growth in exchange for that consistent cash flow but are you really here to chase lottery tickets or are you here to get paid jeq plays it smart and that's why it's paying me every single month While most people are hoping their stock doesn't crash let's talk numbers because most people don't get this the S&amp;P 500 it's fine you'll get 1.5 to 2% yield if you're lucky but that's nothing if you're trying to live off dividends you'll need Millions but that's nothing if you're trying to live off dividends you'll need Millions invested just to make it work and even then you're barely scraping buy meanwhile jpq is currently paying out over 12% let me put that in perspective if you've got 100,000 in the S&amp;P 500 you're making $1,500 a year with JQ you're making over 12,000 that's eight times the income and it's not just about the yield JQ is Tech heavy and over the last few years it's outperforming the S&amp;P 500 so while everyone else is waiting for their growth stocks to take off your cashing checks every single month let's talk specifics I now own 404 shares of jpq and that's worth about $218,000 this month those shares paid me $2,111 that's money I didn't have to work for it just shows up month after month now I didn't start with $218,000 I started with a few thousand bucks and built it up over time but the point is I'm not relying on on some speculative stock to hit it big I'm getting paid every month and I'm using that money to keep building it's a machine the best part you can start today and here's how you really build wealth by reinvesting those dividends let me show you what I do last month I made $2,111 from JQ the current price is around $54 a share so I'm taking that cash and buying roughly 39 more shares those 39 Shares are going to pay me next month and then I'll buy even more shares you see how this works every month I'm adding more shares and every month I'm getting paid more it's compounding it's called The Snowball Effect and here's the kicker every time you reinvest your money Works harder for you instead of just sitting in a bank account doing nothing it's growing and multiplying the more shares I have the bigger the dividend payouts that's how you build real wealth and that's how you set yourself up to retire on just dividends I know what you're thinking I don't have $218,000 to drop into an ETF well guess what neither did I when I started I was 22 years old just out of the Marine Corps with a few thousand bucks and I had to grind my way here but here's the thing it's not about how much you have right now it's about starting even if you've only got $500 or $1,000 you can get in the game the key is to start and if you're sitting on equity in your house why not downsize free up that capital and put it to work you can keep sitting on your house and hoping it appreciates or you can take control of your financial future right now the choice is yours don't sit on the sidelines while your money sits idle and here's the deal the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago the second best time right now so stop making excuses get off your ass and start investing I started with nothing I was a broke 22-year-old just out of the Marine Corps but I worked my ass off made smart Investments and now I'm 54 living the life I always wanted and you can do it too but you have to start now there's no secret formula there's no shortcut it's just about starting staying consistent and making your money work for you so don't wait for the

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en let me make something clear you're either getting paid while you sleep or you're working until you die most people choose the second option whether they realize it or not so ask yourself do you want to keep running in place or do you want to build a machine that pays you while you do nothing because that's what jeq does it's paying me every month over $2,100 and I'm not doing a damn thing to earn it want to know how keep watching here's the truth most people invest like amateurs they're buying stocks crossing their fingers and hoping picked a winner it's a guessing game and guess what they lose JQ it's not a guessing game it's predictable the thing has been around for over two years now and it's paying out a 12.46% 30-day SEC yield that's real money every single month and the 12-month rolling dividend yield is 10.02% while everyone else is sitting around hoping their stock jumps 5% next year I'm getting paid right now it's up 9.68% this year and it's focused on big Tech but here's what makes it different it's not just about the stock going up it's about the monthly cash flow you see you're not waiting for the market to decide your fate jeq pays you every month no matter what's happening out there and that's the difference between people who are hoping to get rich and people who are already getting paid let me put it this way last month I added well over $100,000 into jpq why because it pays me every single month and because interest rates are coming down in in the money market fund where I had the cash parked so I was seeking higher returns for that money the beauty is I don't need to wait for some big Market Rally or play the long game hoping my stock hits no I'm getting cash every 30 days I now own 44.7 one shares of JQ and this month they paid me $2,111 in dividends let me say that again $2,111 that's money in my pocket money that I didn't have to work for and the best

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en have you ever caught yourself imagining a life where your Investments are the ones working overtime and not you think about it building a passive income that frees you from The Daily Grind today we're diving into the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF ticker symbol JQ with insights that might just change your game plan this ETS performance with an 18.78% Total return in the past year has caught my eye and it's time you take a closer look too and just to be clear JP Morgan has two dividend ETFs the more well-known JPI and the newer jeq which will be our Focus today your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we'll break down jq's fundamentals like its low expense ratio and how it targets premium income from leading stocks next we'll explore why jq's mix of tech heavy Holdings has me excited especially in today's market then we'll run some real world scenarios I'll show you how a $50,000 investment in JQ could outperform your day jobs in income with updated returns and growth next we'll cover why jpq could be a powerful long-term play for those looking to blend income and growth and finally we'll compare jeq to SCD and jei to see which one is better for you stick around because the ending will surprise you and if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if

salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",JP Morgan,0.9,0.8

you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in

average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",Microsoft,1.0,0.7

building a passive income that frees you from The Daily Grind today we're diving into the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF ticker symbol JQ with insights that might just change your game plan this ETS performance with an 18.78% Total return in the past year has caught my eye and it's time you take a closer look too and just to be clear JP Morgan has two dividend ETFs the more well-known JPI and the newer jeq which will be our Focus today your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we'll break down jq's fundamentals like its low expense ratio and how it targets premium income from leading stocks next we'll explore why jq's mix of tech heavy Holdings has me excited especially in today's market then we'll run some real world scenarios I'll show you how a $50,000 investment in JQ could outperform your day jobs in income with updated returns and growth next we'll cover why jpq could be a powerful long-term play for those looking to blend income and growth and finally we'll compare jeq to SCD and jei to see which one is better for you stick around because the ending will surprise you and if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement

your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",Amazon,1.0,0.6

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en have you ever caught yourself imagining a life where your Investments are the ones working overtime and not you think about it building a passive income that frees you from The Daily Grind today we're diving into the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF ticker symbol JQ with insights that might just change your game plan this ETS performance with an 18.78% Total return in the past year has caught my eye and it's time you take a closer look too and just to be clear JP Morgan has two dividend ETFs the more well-known JPI and the newer jeq which will be our Focus today your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we'll break down jq's fundamentals like its low expense ratio and how it targets premium income from leading stocks next we'll explore why jq's mix of tech heavy Holdings has me excited especially in today's market then we'll run some real world scenarios I'll show you how a $50,000 investment in JQ could outperform your day jobs in income with updated returns and growth next we'll cover why jpq could be a powerful long-term play for those looking to blend income and growth and finally we'll compare jeq to SCD and jei to see which one is better for you stick around because the ending will surprise you and if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus

capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",Alphabet,1.0,0.6

building a passive income that frees you from The Daily Grind today we're diving into the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF ticker symbol JQ with insights that might just change your game plan this ETS performance with an 18.78% Total return in the past year has caught my eye and it's time you take a closer look too and just to be clear JP Morgan has two dividend ETFs the more well-known JPI and the newer jeq which will be our Focus today your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we'll break down jq's fundamentals like its low expense ratio and how it targets premium income from leading stocks next we'll explore why jq's mix of tech heavy Holdings has me excited especially in today's market then we'll run some real world scenarios I'll show you how a $50,000 investment in JQ could outperform your day jobs in income with updated returns and growth next we'll cover why jpq could be a powerful long-term play for those looking to blend income and growth and finally we'll compare jeq to SCD and jei to see which one is better for you stick around because the ending will surprise you and if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",Tesla,1.0,0.6

field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",Netflix,1.0,0.6

building a passive income that frees you from The Daily Grind today we're diving into the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF ticker symbol JQ with insights that might just change your game plan this

the newer jeq which will be our Focus today your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we'll break down jq's fundamentals like its low expense ratio and how it targets premium income from leading stocks next we'll explore why jq's mix of tech heavy Holdings has me excited especially in today's market then we'll run some real world scenarios I'll show you how a $50,000 investment in JQ could outperform your day jobs in income with updated returns and growth next we'll cover why jpq could be a powerful long-term play for those looking to blend income and growth and finally we'll compare jeq to SCD and jei to see which one is better for you stick around because the ending will surprise you and if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's jump right into it the JP Morgan Equity premium income ETF better known as JQ here's the deal it's a strategic play that combines a focus on premium income with a low expense ratio of just 35% think of jpq as a tech forward Powerhouse with almost half its portfolio and technology stocks this isn't just any ETF it's built to capture premium income while still keeping you connected to growth sectors like Tech communication and consumer cyclical stocks but here's where JQ sets itself apart it's not just targeting High dividends it's tapping into premium income by selling options what does this mean while you're invested in top tier tech companies like apple Microsoft and Nvidia you're also earning additional income through option premiums it's like having your cake and eating it too JQ manages to deliver income without sacrificing the potential for capital appreciation all while keeping expenses in check jpq isn't just about the short-term gains it's built for investors who want to play the long game its blend of income generation and growth exposure means you're not just relying on dividends you're also positioned for Market upside and with 49.99% of its Holdings in technology jpq tap Taps into some of the most dynamic sectors in the market it's a balanced approach that doesn't lean too hard in any One Direction giving you a smoother ride in both Bull and bare markets here's why JQ has me excited it's not just another ETF it's strategically loaded with tech giants like apple Microsoft and Nvidia which make up a significant chunk of its Holdings these aren't just companies they're Market Leaders with robust growth potential and with jq's approach to generating income through options you're not just waiting for divid ends you're actively earning plus the fund's 18.78% total return over the past year shows it's more than just hype JQ is well positioned to benefit from whatever the market throws its way in a rising interest rate environment premium income strategies can provide a cushion against volatility and when rates eventually come down and they will the tech heavy composition of jpq could see significant capital gains this is the kind of flexibility that makes jeq a standout choice for income focused investors s who still want to capture market growth let's talk about the Heavy Hitters in jq's lineup Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta alphabet better known as Google broadcom Tesla Netflix and nx9 these top 10 Holdings account for 41.836899 comping choice for forward-looking investors jq's sector exposure is heavily weighted towards technology at 49.99% followed by communication services and consumer cyclical sectors this isn't by accident it's designed to capture growth where it's happening most but it doesn't stop there it also has stakes in health care consumer defensive and even a sliver in utilities and financials this diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket but you're still staying close to the hottest sectors of the Market when it comes to income jeq delivers in Spades by focusing on option premiums it adds a unique twist to traditional dividend investing it's like having a second source of income boosting your overall returns while still keeping you in the game with high growth tech stocks the 35% expense ratio ensures that more of that income flows back to you rather than getting lost in high fees this dual approach is what makes JQ a standout in a crowded market for our dividend calculator we need a solid dividend year figure and from JP Morgan site it's 9.93% for the last 12 months keep that 9.93% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind and also notice I'm using the annual yield which is the lowest yield because I want to stay conservative next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout in the last year that growth was a whopping 29.82 2% now I prefer to use the averages over 5 or 10 years but we can't do that because JQ started in 2022 so I'm going to stay conservative and use SD's 11.01% and that's going into our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since jq's Inception in May of 2022 it's produced a return of 38.636049 has been a little more conservative and has a stock appreciation of 13.16% that being said with 49% of jq's Holdings in technology companies including Nvidia it's possible jpq could maintain High appreciation numbers but for today's video I want to use a lower share price appreciation percentage that I believe is more realistic in the last year JQ is up 7.61% sure there will be ups and downs and I prefer using an average of 5 or 10 years but we'll use 7. 61% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage the key figures I'm using for the initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from jq's track record or toned down numbers due to the limited history and one of the most powerful strategies with jpq is reinvesting the premium income to buy more shares this compound accounting effect accelerates your portfolio's growth turning even modest returns into significant gains over time it's like a snowball rolling downhill each premium payment reinvested adds momentum helping your investment grow faster and bigger than just sitting on dividends alone now let's dive into a scenario that's not just Theory but a potential reality with just 50,000 in JQ you could set yourself up for income that rivals or even surpasses your full-time jobs paycheck and sets you up for a rich retirement and if you're finding value here a like And subscribe would be awesome for those of you looking to dive deeper check out my patreon for realtime alerts and exclusive insights plus there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view indicators thanks for sticking around and now let's run the numbers through the dividend calculator to see exactly how jpq could transform your financial future all right let's go through our dividend calculator and set everything up first thing we want to do is come down to distribution frequency and we want to change that from annually to monthly since jpq pays monthly we want to make sure that the drip is on our starting principle today is going to be $50,000 here we go 5012 3 annual contribution will keep at zero our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 9.93% next we need the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year and this can be a little bit confusing but this is a very important number so for that we can hover over the little question mark and it tells us if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than the expected annual share price appreciation percentage so we're actually going to start with 11.01% but I got to warn you this is something we're going to have to change because this is just going to blow these numbers away and then our next one is going to be the expected annual share price appreciation percentage per year for that we're going to use 7.61% and now we are ready to go ahead and hit the calculate dividends button and boom we can see some crazy numbers here ending balance $21 million total return uh the annual dividend income that would be nice but what's really surprising here is the average annual return is 22.4 2% yes that's high but again is it possible uh maybe but I want to tone this down so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change our expected annual dividend amount increase percentage from 11.01% let's drop that down to 4% and now when we hit calculate dividends we get a more realistic number and now at the end of year 1 we can see that our principal started at 50,000 our annual dividend was $5,195 our yield 9.93% and you can see the numbers coming across here and that looks you know all right uh then as we come down the thing really starts to grow and this is the power of compound in and building that snowball after 5 years the principal is just over 90,000 annual dividend $ 8,159 at 10 years 180,000 with just over 13,000 for the dividend 15 years 340,000 and 21,000 for the annual dividend coming on down let's check out 20 years 617,000 with a 32,000 dividend 25 years wow we just popped over $1 million for the principal and our annual dividend is is now at $ 48,2 73 and then at 30 years $1.8 million and an annual dividend of $68,400 so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance $2,318 n6 Total return 3,963 average annual return 13.14% and really take notice of this number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from jpq no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math don't take my word for it try it out on marketbeat.com free dividend calculator yourself today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for life jpq is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new

number we're only outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by just a little bit but look how much this has grown to and this is what we're after our annual dividend income $ 73,8 and our yield on cost 137.5 per. does this blow you guys away now I know not everybody is in a position to drop $50,000 into jbq right now so let's run a couple different scenarios let's go ahead and say you can start with $10,000 in principal and you can put in $100 per month so that would be an annual contribution ution of $1,200 let's hit calculate dividends and see where we're at well we're at $728,000 for the ending balance annual dividend income 26421 28 let's bump this up to 2400 which I think most of you guys can do that's $200 a month and now we're looking at an ending balance of 1 million so you're a millionaire a average annual return 8.87% annual dividend income $38,500 per month which would work out to $3600 per year and again a lot of you guys can do that so we're looking at an ending balance of $1,372 th000 annual dividend income $4 49,7 189 and again you guys can play with this calculator and run your own numbers and now let's run one more scenario I'm really big on investing in retirement accounts and Roth IRAs and the reason I like a Roth is because it is tax-free now I've had the question before how can you put $50,000 in a Roth there are a couple of ways one you can do it over time do your annual contributions and for high income earners something you really should do is talk to your CBA about doing what's called a backdoor Roth IRA with that you can put in money quicker so now let's go ahead and just say you can do it in a Roth IRA what we're going to do is we're going to take away that dividend tax rate we're going to set it to zero now if we look at our ending balance before with a 15% tax rate then it was coming in at just over $2 million and our annual dividend income was $73,345 not too shabby but now if we can do this in a Roth IRA no tax consequences check this out the numbers now change to $2.6 million and our annual dividend income $95,900 Roth 401k even though we can't predict the market using jq's historical data gives us a solid foundation for projections and while we can only base these on past performance the numbers make a compelling case for why JQ deserves a spot in your long-term investment strategy jq's strong returns Tech heavy portfolio and income generating strategies offer a balanced approach for The Savvy investor by reinvesting your premiums and letting compounding do its work a $50,000 investment could set you on a path to financial Independence as you can see from today's video the numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild

will thank you so which one takes the crown jeq SD or jepi look SD has a rock solid 13-year track record it's been around the block it's got history and it's proven then there's jpq this is the new kit on the Block it doesn't have the years under its belt for a full-blown comparison but it's showing great promise now if we Zoom in on the last year where all these ETFs were playing on the same field here's how they Stack Up number one JQ with 18.78% number two SCD at 16.88% and number three jei at 12.64% so jpq is leading the pack right now but here's the kicker we need more data a few more years of performance to see if jpq can keep up this pace or IFD will reclaim the top spot because consistency beats hype every time and in case you're wondering I own both jeq andd in my portfolio if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","This YouTube transcript strongly promotes the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) as a powerful vehicle for generating passive income and achieving financial independence, potentially exceeding a full-time job's salary.

The video advocates for a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, recommending dividend reinvestment (DRIP) and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs for accelerated, tax-free growth. The presenter personally holds both JEPQ and SCHD.

JEPQ's strategy involves generating ""premium income"" by selling options on its holdings, which are heavily weighted (nearly 50%) towards top-tier technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, thus providing both income and growth exposure. The ETF features a low 0.35% expense ratio. Performance highlights include an 18.78% total return over the past year and a 9.93% annual dividend yield.

Conservative projections, assuming a 4% annual dividend growth and 7.61% annual share price appreciation, suggest a $50,000 initial investment in JEPQ, reinvested over 30 years, could result in an ending balance of approximately $2.3 million and over $73,800 in annual pre-tax dividend income. In a Roth IRA, these figures increase to $2.6 million and over $95,900 in tax-free annual income. While JEPQ has outperformed SCHD (16.88%) and JEPI (12.64%) over the last year, the presenter cautions that its newer status requires more long-term data for consistent validation.

The video emphasizes the transformative power of compounding and the strategic advantage of options-based income in a diversified, tech-heavy portfolio. It stresses that while past performance is not indicative of future results, JEPQ's historical data provides a ""solid foundation for projections"" and a ""compelling case"" for long-term investment, strongly advocating for proactive and early investment.",MarketBeat.com,0.8,0.2

consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend

let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend

frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760

our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with your CPA playing with the dividend calculator is eye-opening and while we can't predict the next 30 Years using real historical numbers from SCD gives us a solid projection in fact the actual results could be even better here's a key takeway away for every investor beginner or seasoned you don't need a fortune to set up your future where your Investments work for you smart choices like SD even starting with $50,000 or growing your portfolio bit by bit can eventually replace your income smart investing in patience can change the game let's do a quick recap a $50,000 investment in SD turns into 37731 70 the total return $ 7, 446 the average annual return 15.5% after 30 years your annual dividend income is over $7,795 some of you are probably sitting there thinking are these numbers even real let's break it down SD's lifetime average annual return is 15.5% over the last 5 years the total return's been 17.1% and without dividends it's 11.2% those are legit numbers no love just facts these numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from SCD no

daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns. The speaker concludes that these projections, based on ""real historical data,"" position SCHD as a ""financial GameChanger"" for long-term investors, asserting that even 50% of the projected returns would lead to millionaire status.",Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF,1.0,1.0

daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns. The speaker concludes that these projections, based on ""real historical data,"" position SCHD as a ""financial GameChanger"" for long-term investors, asserting that even 50% of the projected returns would lead to millionaire status.",Schwab,0.9,0.8

first we're breaking down SD the nuts and bolts like its low expense ratio and laser focus on dividend growth next whyd has got me fired up spoiler it's about performance and that sweet consistent dividend yield then we'll crunch real world numbers I'll show you how 50,000 in SD could not just match but crush your job income through dividends and growth with updated figures that will blow you away finally we'll wrap up with a mind-blowing benefits ofd as a long-term play and trust me the finale is a Twist you won't see coming if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's get straight into it the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as SCD here's what you need to know it's a lowcost ETF with an expense ratio of just .6% think ofd as your future retirement in action providing peace of mind with a blend of stability dividends and growth it's not just any ETF it's like having a perfectly curated playlist of stocks from various sectors giving you exposure to everything from Tech to healthcare now here's the kicker SCD focuses on dividend growth it's not just about stocks that pay dividends but those with the potential to increase those payouts over time all this while keeping fees ridiculously low investing in SCD is like planting a money tree that grows not just through the value of the ETF but through bigger dividend checks year after year without losing a chunk to high fees SD is built for those playing the long game those who want steady income and growth it's more than just an ETF it's your gateway to financial growth SCD strikes a balance earning from Market ups and downs with the added bonus of being costeffective and consistently paying dividends here's whyd has me excited and why it's not just another ETF on the market picture this SD is trading around $84 per share flirting with all-time Highs but can it go higher absolutely we're in this for the Long Haul 30 years and Beyond so today's price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return

you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns.

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en did you ever catch yourself daydreaming about ditching that 9 to-5 grind imagine your Investments doing all the heavy lifting so you don't have to if that sounds like a dream it's about to get real today we're diving back into the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF ticker symbol SD with an update that's going to blow your mind I showed you before how 50,000 in SD could beat your job's income but guess what the returns are even better than we thought your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we're breaking down SD the nuts and bolts like its low expense ratio and laser focus on dividend growth next whyd has got me fired up spoiler it's about performance and that sweet consistent dividend yield then we'll crunch real world numbers I'll show you how 50,000 in SD could not just match but crush your job income through dividends and growth with updated figures that will blow you away finally we'll wrap up with a mind-blowing benefits ofd as a long-term play and trust me the finale is a Twist you won't see coming if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's get straight into it the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as SCD here's what you need to know it's a lowcost ETF with an expense ratio of just .6% think ofd as your future retirement in action providing peace of mind with a blend of stability dividends and growth it's not just any ETF it's like having a perfectly curated playlist of stocks from various sectors giving you exposure to everything from Tech to healthcare now here's the kicker SCD focuses on dividend growth it's not just about stocks that pay dividends but those with the potential to increase those payouts over time all this while keeping fees ridiculously low investing in SCD is like planting a money tree that grows not just through the value of the ETF but through bigger dividend checks year after year without losing a chunk to high fees SD is built for those playing the long game those who want steady income and growth it's more than just an ETF it's your gateway to financial growth SCD strikes a balance earning from Market ups and downs with the added bonus of being costeffective and consistently paying dividends here's whyd has me excited and why it's not just another ETF on the market picture this SD is trading around $84 per share flirting with all-time Highs but can it go higher absolutely we're in this for the Long Haul 30 years and Beyond so today's price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en did you ever catch yourself daydreaming about ditching that 9 to-5 grind imagine your Investments doing all the heavy lifting so you don't have to if that sounds like a dream it's about to get real today we're diving back into the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF ticker symbol SD with an update that's going to blow your mind I showed you before how 50,000 in SD could beat your job's income but guess what the returns are even better than we thought your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we're breaking down SD the nuts and bolts like its low expense ratio and laser focus on dividend growth next whyd has got me fired up spoiler it's about performance and that sweet consistent dividend yield then we'll crunch real world numbers I'll show you how 50,000 in SD could not just match but crush your job income through dividends and growth with updated figures that will blow you away finally we'll wrap up with a mind-blowing benefits ofd as a long-term play and trust me the finale is a Twist you won't see coming if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's get straight into it the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as SCD here's what you need to know it's a lowcost ETF with an expense ratio of just .6% think ofd as your future retirement in action providing peace of mind with a blend of stability dividends and growth it's not just any ETF it's like having a perfectly curated playlist of stocks from various sectors giving you exposure to everything from Tech to healthcare now here's the kicker SCD focuses on dividend growth it's not just about stocks that pay dividends but those with the potential to increase those payouts over time all this while keeping fees ridiculously low investing in SCD is like planting a money tree that grows not just through the value of the ETF but through bigger dividend checks year after year without losing a chunk to high fees SD is built for those playing the long game those who want steady income and growth it's more than just an ETF it's your gateway to financial growth SCD strikes a balance earning from Market ups and downs with the added bonus of being costeffective and consistently paying dividends here's whyd has me excited and why it's not just another ETF on the market picture this SD is trading around $84 per share flirting with all-time Highs but can it go higher absolutely we're in this for the Long Haul 30 years and Beyond so today's price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with your CPA playing with the dividend calculator is eye-opening and while we can't predict the next 30 Years using real historical numbers from SCD gives us a solid projection in fact the actual results could be even better here's a key takeway away for every investor beginner or seasoned you don't need a fortune to set up your future where your Investments work for you smart choices like SD even starting with $50,000 or growing your portfolio bit by bit can eventually replace your income smart investing in patience can change the game let's do a quick recap a $50,000 investment in SD turns

these numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from SCD no

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en did you ever catch yourself daydreaming about ditching that 9 to-5 grind imagine your Investments doing all the heavy lifting so you don't have to if that sounds like a dream it's about to get real today we're diving back into the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF ticker symbol SD with an update that's going to blow your mind I showed you before how 50,000 in SD could beat your job's income but guess what the returns are even better than we thought your time is valuable so I won't waste it here's exactly what we're covering first we're breaking down SD the nuts and bolts like its low expense ratio and laser focus on dividend growth next whyd has got me fired up spoiler it's about performance and that sweet consistent dividend yield then we'll crunch real world numbers I'll show you how 50,000 in SD could not just match but crush your job income through dividends and growth with updated figures that will blow you away finally we'll wrap up with a mind-blowing benefits ofd as a long-term play and trust me the finale is a Twist you won't see coming if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's get straight into it the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as SCD here's what you need to know it's a lowcost ETF with an expense ratio of just .6% think ofd as your future retirement in action providing peace of mind with a blend of stability dividends and growth it's not just any ETF it's like having a perfectly curated playlist of stocks from various sectors giving you exposure to everything from Tech to healthcare now here's the kicker SCD focuses on dividend growth it's not just about stocks that pay dividends but those with the potential to increase those payouts over time all this while keeping fees ridiculously low investing in SCD is like planting a money tree that grows not just through the value of the ETF but through bigger dividend checks year after year without losing a chunk to high fees SD is built for those playing the long game those who want steady income and growth it's more than just an ETF it's your gateway to financial growth SCD strikes a balance earning from Market ups and downs with the added bonus of being costeffective and consistently paying dividends here's whyd has me excited and why it's not just another ETF on the market picture this SD is trading around $84 per share flirting with all-time Highs but can it go higher absolutely we're in this for the Long Haul 30 years and Beyond so today's price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with your CPA playing with the dividend calculator is eye-opening and while we can't predict the next 30 Years using real historical numbers from SCD gives us a solid projection in fact the actual results could be even better here's a key takeway away for every investor beginner or seasoned you don't need a fortune to set up your future where your Investments work for you smart choices like SD even starting with $50,000 or growing your portfolio bit by bit can eventually replace your income smart investing in patience can change the game let's do a quick recap a $50,000 investment in SD turns into 37731 70 the total return $ 7, 446 the average annual return 15.5% after 30 years your annual dividend income is over $7,795 some of you are probably sitting there thinking are these numbers even real let's break it down SD's lifetime average annual return is 15.5% over the last 5 years the total return's been 17.1% and without dividends it's 11.2% those are legit numbers no love just facts these numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from SCD no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math and even if you only hit 50% of these results you're still walking away a millionaire don't take my word for it try it out yourself with Market beats free dividend calculator today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for Life SD is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that speaks for itself if you're hunting for a financial GameChanger this is it don't just sit on the sidelines get your snowball rolling today because the sooner you start the bigger that snowball gets and trust me your future self will thank you if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns. The speaker concludes that these projections, based on ""real historical data,"" position SCHD as a ""financial GameChanger"" for long-term investors, asserting that even 50% of the projected returns would lead to millionaire status.",Cisco Systems,1.0,0.8

first we're breaking down SD the nuts and bolts like its low expense ratio and laser focus on dividend growth next whyd has got me fired up spoiler it's about performance and that sweet consistent dividend yield then we'll crunch real world numbers I'll show you how 50,000 in SD could not just match but crush your job income through dividends and growth with updated figures that will blow you away finally we'll wrap up with a mind-blowing benefits ofd as a long-term play and trust me the finale is a Twist you won't see coming if you're new here hit subscribe and ring that Bell so you're always in the loop [Music] let's get straight into it the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as SCD here's what you need to know it's a lowcost ETF with an expense ratio of just .6% think ofd as your future retirement in action providing peace of mind with a blend of stability dividends and growth it's not just any ETF it's like having a perfectly curated playlist of stocks from various sectors giving you exposure to everything from Tech to healthcare now here's the kicker SCD focuses on dividend growth it's not just about stocks that pay dividends but those with the potential to increase those payouts over time all this while keeping fees ridiculously low investing in SCD is like planting a money tree that grows not just through the value of the ETF but through bigger dividend checks year after year without losing a chunk to high fees SD is built for those playing the long game those who want steady income and growth it's more than just an ETF it's your gateway to financial growth SCD strikes a balance earning from Market ups and downs with the added bonus of being costeffective and consistently paying dividends here's whyd has me excited and why it's not just another ETF on the market picture this SD is trading around $84 per share flirting with all-time Highs but can it go higher absolutely we're in this for the Long Haul 30 years and Beyond so today's price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with your CPA playing with the dividend calculator is eye-opening and while we can't predict the next 30 Years using real historical numbers from SCD gives us a solid projection in fact the actual results could be even better here's a key takeway away for every investor beginner or seasoned you don't need a fortune to set up your future where your Investments work for you smart choices like SD even starting with $50,000 or growing your portfolio bit by bit can eventually replace your income smart investing in patience can change the game let's do a quick recap a $50,000 investment in SD turns into 37731 70 the total return $ 7, 446 the average annual return 15.5% after 30 years your annual dividend income is over $7,795 some of you are probably sitting there thinking are these numbers even real let's break it down SD's lifetime average annual return is 15.5% over the last 5 years the total return's been 17.1% and without dividends it's 11.2% those are legit numbers no love just facts these numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from SCD no fluff no hype that's just the raw power of math and even if you only hit 50% of these results you're still walking away a millionaire don't take my word for it try it out yourself with Market beats free dividend calculator today's video isn't just about investing it's about making decisions that set you up for Life SD is the real deal reliable dividends solid growth and a track record that

and trust me your future self will thank you if you're serious about leveling up your investing game and want the inside scoop join my patreon you'll get real-time trade alerts my top picks and a daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns. The speaker concludes that these projections, based on ""real historical data,"" position SCHD as a ""financial GameChanger"" for long-term investors, asserting that even 50% of the projected returns would lead to millionaire status.",Verizon Communications,1.0,0.8

price is just a blip on the radar and here's another game changer the FED is planning to lower interest rates lower rates make borrowing cheaper for everyone including the big companies that SD holds this means more profit for these companies more spending from consumers and ultimately bigger dividends for you and in a low rate environment dividend stocks especially reliable ones become even more attractive which could push SD's price even higher what really makes SD a conservative investors dream is its top 10 Holdings we're talking about Rock Solid companies like Lockheed Martin ABY Coca-Cola Black Rock Home Depot Bristol Meyer squib Cisco Systems amen Verizon communications and Texas Instruments it's a dividend lovers dream lineup SCD sector exposure is perfectly balanced 17.3% in financials 15.5% in healthcare 14.3% in Consumer Staples 13.3% in Industrials 133% in energy and the rest spread across other sectors this kind of diversification means you're not betting the farm on just one sector even if a few stocks underperform SD's broad exposure protects you from major hits and about those dividends the 12- month trailing yield is 3.42% it's not flashy but it's consistent and that's what counts in the long run check out SD's dividend growth over the last decade it's been climbing steadily this is key when we start plugging numbers into the dividend calculator we need a solid dividend yield figure and from Schwab's site it's 3.42% for the last 12 months keep that 3.42% locked in because it's going straight into the initial annual dividend yield input of our dividend calculator I want to make sure you know where these numbers are coming from because the final numbers will blow your mind next we need the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 10 years that's been 11.01% this 11% is going right into our expected annual ual dividend amount increase percentage per year and that's an input in the dividend calculator now let's talk about stock appreciation since SD's Inception in October of 2011 it's produced an annualized return of 13.28% and that's without even counting dividends in the last year alone SD is up 12.82% sure there will be ups and downs but using the 13e average of 13.28% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage is a Sol Bet the Key figures I'm using initial annual dividend yield expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreciation percentage are all based on historical performance this isn't some inflated estimate these are real numbers from SD's track record looking at the bigger picture these 13-year numbers make a strong case Ford as a top choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SCD to buy more shares this strategy supercharges your growth over 30 years thanks to compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the longer it rolls the bigger it gets that's how you build wealth with SCD now let's see how just 50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job and set you up for a rich retirement and if you're getting value here a like And subscribe would mean a lot for those looking to dive deeper into trading my patreon offers realtime alerts and there's a free trial link below for my custom trading view in indicators thanks for being here and with that let's jump into the dividend calculator to run the numbers all right let's go ahead and get our dividend calculator set up the first thing we want to do is change the dividend frequency and that's going to go from annually to quarterly next we want to make sure the drip is on and that's the reinvestment and then we need to set up our starting principle that's going to be $50,000 and then after that we want to come down and look at our initial annual dividend yield that's going to be 3.42% after that we've got the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year that's going to be 11.01% and this could be a little bit confusing and if the dividend amount grows at the same rate as the share price the yield will stay the same over time if you expect the dividend yield to increase over time enter a slightly larger expected annual dividend amount increase percentage than expected annual share price appreciation percentage so this is going over how to set this up and again we're using actual historical numbers and then we need to set up the expected annual share price appreciation per year that's going to be 13.28% and the year's invested we're going to set that to 30 years now we need to calculate the dividends and then let's go over those numbers now in the beginning these numbers aren't that impressive it's just like a snowball when it starts rolling it's nothing after year one our principal is 50,000 our annual dividend is $1,732 after year five we're up to 9,957 $7 in principal $292 in the annual dividend let's go down to 10 years and we're at $119,950 476 for the annual dividend let's jump down to 15 years our principle is now $392,900 th000 in change in principal our annual div dividend is now $118,800 we're up to $1,631 760 in principal the annual dividend is now $34,636 years we're at $3,283 650 the annual dividend $628 183 now let's recap our dividend portfolio after 30 years the ending balance is going to be 3,773 70 our total return a whopping $ 7,446 per the average annual return 15.5% the annual dividend income is now up to $ 7,799 the total dividend payouts over 30 years $533,500 then not everybody can drop $50,000 today into SCD so let's run a couple different scenarios let's say you're starting with $10,000 in principal you can put that in today and your annual contribution is going to be $100 per month that works out to $1,200 per year on an annual basis and when we hit calculate dividends now we can see our ending balance would still be $1.3 million Total return 2762 average annual return 11.83% annual dividend income is up to $4,734 let's say you can do a little bit better and do $200 per month or $2,400 per year check out what that does to the numbers we're now up to 1,878 th000 Total return 2,190 average annual return 11% and our annual dividend income is up to $ 35,246 and one more scenario $300 per month which would work out to $3 $600 per year hit that calculate dividends button and what are we at $2.4 million for an ending balance the average annual return 10.62% annual dividend income $45,988 not too shabby and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantaged accounts so if you can do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k it can definitely be worth your while so what we want to do is you want to look at right now our ending balance is $3.77 3 million and our annual dividend income is roughly $71,000 per year let's go ahead and change our dividend tax rate because it'll be in a Roth or a Roth 401k to zero all we do now is hit calculate dividends and I want you to watch what happens to these numbers so when we hit calculate dividends our annual dividend income is now up to $ 78,3 75 so roughly $7,000 more per year by doing it in a tax advantaged account and our ending balance is now 4,176 n25 guys if you can do this in tax advantage accounts it's definitely the way to go and of course always check with your CPA playing with the dividend calculator is eye-opening and while we can't predict the next 30 Years using real historical numbers from SCD gives us a solid projection in fact the actual results could be even better here's a key takeway away for every investor beginner or seasoned you don't need a fortune to set up your future where your Investments work for you smart choices like SD even starting with $50,000 or growing your portfolio bit by bit can eventually replace your income smart investing in patience can change the game let's do a quick recap a $50,000 investment in SD turns into 37731 70 the total return $ 7, 446 the average annual return 15.5% after 30 years your annual dividend income is over $7,795 some of you are probably sitting there thinking are these numbers even real let's break it down SD's lifetime average annual return is 15.5% over the last 5 years the total return's been 17.1% and without dividends it's 11.2% those are legit numbers no love just facts these numbers are insane and that's exactly why I've laid out every detail so you can see how to run the numbers yourself here's the wild part all of this is based on real historical data from SCD no

daily rundown of the hottest stocks the Link's in the description don't sleep on the next big opportunity and hey drop a comment below so we can keep this conversation rolling stay sharp and I'll see you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD COULD Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a path to long-term financial independence. The central thesis is that SCHD, with its low 0.06% expense ratio and focus on dividend-growing companies, has the potential to generate income comparable to or exceeding a full-time job through consistent dividend growth and share price appreciation.

This optimistic outlook is supported by SCHD's strong fundamentals, the anticipated boost from Federal Reserve interest rate cuts benefiting dividend stocks, and robust historical performance data: a 3.42% trailing dividend yield, an 11.01% 10-year average dividend growth rate, and 13.28% annualized share price appreciation since its 2011 inception. The ""magic"" of compounding and dividend reinvestment (DRIP) is heavily emphasized.

Scenario analysis projects that a $50,000 initial investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years, could grow to over $3.77 million in principal, yielding over $71,000 in annual dividend income. Alternative scenarios with smaller initial investments combined with monthly contributions also forecast multi-million dollar outcomes, with an added benefit highlighted for investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA to maximize net returns. The speaker concludes that these projections, based on ""real historical data,"" position SCHD as a ""financial GameChanger"" for long-term investors, asserting that even 50% of the projected returns would lead to millionaire status.",MarketBeat,0.9,0.3

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey folks Jerry Roman here diving into the world of stock options without the fluff this video will leave you revved up for our next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun [Music] welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your cover is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $111 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon on and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you ride a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance first off options trading it's like being given the keys to a potentially lucrative Kingdom but with great power comes great responsibility options are contracts that offer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at at a specific price on or before a certain date now while options can turbocharge your portfolio they can also be a quick way to lose money if you're not careful that's where strategies like the merried put come into play providing a safety net as you learn the ropes what is a merried put picture this you've just bought shares of your favorite stock dreaming of the profits you might make but the stock market can be unpredictable like weather in the mountains a merry put is your insurance policy ensuring that even if the stock price falls off a cliff you won't lose your shirt you purchase a put option for the same stock which allows you to sell your shares at a predetermined price no matter how far the actual price may fall it's like having an extra parachute when you're skydiving you hope you won't need it but you're glad it's there just in case and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you would like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free triy Link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's roll up our sleeves and look at a practical example suppose you buy 100 shares of a company called future Tech at $50 each to protect your investment you also buy a put option with a strike price of $45 paying a premium of $2 per share now if future Tech stock takes a nose dive to $40 your put option allows you to sell at $45 significantly reducing your loss this strategy is about minimizing risks and keeping your investment Journey on a steady course the million-dollar question when do you play this card a merried put is ideal when you're bullish on a stock but nervous about short-term risks perhaps due to Market volatility or an upcoming announcement like earnings it's particularly appealing for stocks you believe in long term but are riding through a rocky patch this strategy ensures you're part of the Stock's upside while being shielded from the worst of its downturns every insurance policy comes with a premium and married puts are no different the cost of the put option eats into your potential profits making it crucial to assess whether the protection it offers is worth a price it's about finding that sweet spot where the cost of the put aligns with the level of risk you're willing to accept remember investing is as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns is a merried put right for you incorporating merried puts into your investment strategy signals a thoughtful approach to risk management it's suited for investors who are venturing into options trading with an eye on long-term growth providing a safeguard against the markets ups and downs as you become more comfortable and experienced you'll learn when to employ this strategy to its best Advantage balancing protection with potential [Music] option spreads can seem like a complicated dance of buying and selling but think of them as your strategic moves in the options trading game both credit and debit spreads are about making these moves with precision and strategy aimed at maximizing your gains or minimizing your losses imagine you're a general plotting your next move that's what setting up a credit spread feels like it involves selling a high premium option while simultaneously buying a lower premium option the magic happens because you collect more premium from the option option you sell than what you pay for the one you buy resulting in a credit to your account for example you sell a call option with a strike price of $40 for $1 you've just netted a cool $200 setting the stage for potential profits if the spreads between these options narrow on the flip side let's say you're more of a treasure hunter seeking to uncover value with a bit of an upfront investment this is where debit spreads shine you buy an option that cost more upfront and sell another for Less spending a bit of cash or debit from your account in the hopes that you're chosen direction will pay off handsomely for instance buying a put option for $5 and selling another put option for $1 means you're betting $400 on a strategic move if the market plays in your favor this can lead to significant gains with limited risk deciding between a credit or debit spread is like choosing the right tool for the job credit spreads are your go-to in volatile markets allowing you to collect premiums and possibly benefit from time Decay debit spreads however are best when you expect moderate moves in the market letting you cap capitalize on directional Bets with limited risk I personally prefer credit spreads because you get paid when you open the position and if you do them right you're profitable if the markets are flat move in your direction or even move against you a little bit and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's bring this home with a fictional example we have two stocks alphatech and beta works alphatech is booming and you expect it to to rise you might Implement a bullish credit spread by selling a high premium call and buying a lower premium call on the other hand if you believe beta works is set for a slight dip a debit spread by buying a high premium put and selling a lower premium put might be your best [Music] bet the straddle is your options trading Swiss army knife imagine you're gearing up for a big football game you're not sure if it'll rain bringing a muddy slip and slide Fest or if it'll be clear skies perfect for a passing game in the stock market a stradle is akin to preparing for both outcomes it involves simultaneously purchasing a put and a call option on the same stock at the same strike price and expiring at the same time this dual action move is like having tickets to both potential plays ensuring you're set to capitalize whether the Market's mood swings high or Dives low to truly understand a straddle let's break it down a call option is your bet on the stock Rising it gives you the right to buy at a certain price conversely a put option is your hedge against a fall offering the right to sell when you straddle you're essentially saying Market do your worst or best I'm ready either way it's a powerful statement in the unpredictable world of stocks embodying the essence of being prepared for all eventualities a straddle is the strategy for an indecisive Market ever watch the market and thought it's too quiet something's Brewing that's your cue for a straddle this strategy thrives on anticipated Market trimmers be it due to earnings reports product launches or regulatory shakeups when you sense a big move but can't Peg it as good or bad straddle allows you to play Both Sides ensuring you're in a position to profit from volatility the lifeblood of options trading a wellplayed straddle isn't just a shot in the dark it's a calculated move it involves Keen Market observation understanding potential triggers for volatility and acting before the wave hits this proactive stance can transform uncertainty into opportunity turning the Market's mood swings into potential Profit Stream let's dive into the nitty-gritty of building your straddle picture a stock let's call it Tech genius currently at $100 per share with a major product announcement on the horizon you foresee volatility but can't predict which direction you decide to buy both a put and a call option at a $100 strike price expiring in a month if each option costs $5 your total investment is $10 this premium is your ticket to the volatility feast and the objective is clear Tech genius needs to make a significant move in either direction to cover this cost and then some and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example investing $10 in a straddle means you need tech genius to swing Beyond just covering this cost if it jumps to $15 or drops to $85 you're in profit territory this isn't about modest gains it's about about leveraging major movements for significant Returns the beauty of a straddle lies in its flexibility allowing you to profit from market dynamics while managing the inherent risk of options trading the moment of truth in a straddle strategy hinges on the Stock's performance if tech genius merely wobbles around the $100 Mark the premiums you've paid might as well be tickets to a show where the band never shows up however if it either sares with Innovation or stumbles over a scandal you're set to potentially rake in nice gains this is where your Market Insight paired with a well time straddle can shine turning volatility from a foe into a friend now visualize Tech genius defying expectations rocketing to $120 post announcement your call option is in the Limelight significantly outweighing the put options loss conversely if it tanks to $80 amid disappointment your put option becomes the star performer this Dynamic interplay underscores the straddle Essence it's not about betting on a Direction but betting on a big movement itself no strategy is without its pitfalls and straddles are no exception the key challenge ensuring the Stock's movement is sharp enough to surpass the premiums paid markets that tease with slight moves but never fully commit to a direction can erode the straddle position leaving Traders with a less than Stellar outcome it underscores the importance of strategic selection and timing and deploying this versatile yet nuanced strategy mastering straddles is akin to becoming a myestro of Market moods it involves a deep dive into market indicators understanding The Catalyst for for volatility and importantly knowing when to step back a well time stradle can be a symphony of strategic prowess mistimed it can be a costly lesson in Market humility a strangle strategy might sound complicated but it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it imagine you're at a Crossroads unsure which path to take but you know for sure that staying put isn't an option that's where the strangle strategy shines in options trading you're playing both sides of the field betting on significant movement without worrying about the direction we're talking about buying a call and put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Starbucks let's call it Cafe bucks in our fictional world it's trading at $50 by executing a long strangle you buy a $52 call and a $48 put both expiring next month if Cafe bucks either skyrockets due to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it does you're in profit territory if not well you've got your losses limited by those extra options you bought and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my Trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine you're looking at a stock let's call it future Tech currently priced at $100 you think it's not going to move much you set up your iron Condor around the belief choosing strike prices and collecting premiums up front if future Tech stays between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the money calls by expiration it's like fishing for profits in a calm sea second the short call butterfly this one's a bit more daring aiming for maximum profit when the stock price breaks free for from our set boundaries it's for those who like a bit of a Chase next we have the long put butterfly and short putut butterfly which mirror their counterparts but with puts it's like choosing between skiing or snowboarding different tools same exhilarating slope and then we have the Iron Butterfly and reverse Iron Butterfly which are the heavy metal of the group f- tuned for specific volatility

call butterfly spread we buy calls at $55 and $65 while selling calls at $60 if tiic stays around $60 by expiration we're in profit City but if it Strays too far from $60 well that's where our safety nets the wings minimize The Fallout the beauty of the butterfly spread lies in its balance the risks and rewards are neatly packaged with profits peaking when the market Whispers rather than it shouts but remember commissions can nibble at your gains so keep a Keen Eye on those let's kick things off with the basics imagine you're at a buffet but instead of food you've got a plethora of investment options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them

the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a

*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains.

protection with potential [Music] option spreads can seem like a complicated dance of buying and selling but think of them as your strategic moves in the options trading game both credit and debit spreads are about making these moves with precision and strategy aimed at maximizing your gains or minimizing your losses imagine you're a general plotting your next move that's what setting up a credit spread feels like it involves selling a high premium option while simultaneously buying a lower premium option the magic happens because you collect more premium from the option option you sell than what you pay for the one you buy resulting in a credit to your account for example you sell a call option with a strike price of $40 for $1 you've just netted a cool $200 setting the stage for potential profits if the spreads between these options narrow on the flip side let's say you're more of a treasure hunter seeking to uncover value with a bit of an upfront investment this is where debit spreads shine you buy an option that cost more upfront and sell another for Less spending a bit of cash or debit from your account in the hopes that you're chosen direction will pay off handsomely for instance buying a put option for $5 and selling another put option for $1 means you're betting $400 on a strategic move if the market plays in your favor this can lead to significant gains with limited risk deciding between a credit or debit spread is like choosing the right tool for the job credit spreads are your go-to in volatile markets allowing you to collect premiums and possibly benefit from time Decay debit spreads however are best when you expect moderate moves in the market letting you cap capitalize on directional Bets with limited risk I personally prefer credit spreads because you get paid when you open the position and if you do them right you're profitable if the markets are flat move in your direction or even move against you a little bit and for those

the way let's go over an example let's bring this home with a fictional example we have two stocks alphatech and beta works alphatech is booming and you expect it to to rise you might Implement a bullish credit spread by selling a high premium call and buying a lower premium call on the other hand if you believe beta works is set for a slight dip a debit spread by buying a high premium put and selling a lower premium put might be your best [Music] bet the straddle is your options trading Swiss army knife imagine you're gearing up for a big football game you're not sure if it'll rain bringing a muddy slip and slide Fest or if it'll be clear skies perfect for a passing game in the stock market a stradle is akin to preparing for both outcomes it involves simultaneously purchasing a put and a call option on the same stock at the same strike price and expiring at the same time this dual action move is like having tickets to both potential plays ensuring you're set to capitalize whether the Market's mood swings high or Dives low to truly understand a straddle let's break it down a call option is your bet on the stock Rising it gives you the right to buy at a certain price conversely a put option is your hedge against a fall offering the right to sell when you straddle you're essentially saying Market do your worst or best I'm ready either way it's a powerful statement in the unpredictable world of stocks embodying the essence of being prepared for all eventualities a straddle is the strategy for an indecisive Market ever watch the market and thought it's too quiet something's Brewing that's your cue for a straddle this strategy thrives on anticipated Market trimmers be it due to earnings reports product launches or regulatory shakeups when you sense a big move but can't Peg it as good or bad straddle allows you to play Both Sides ensuring you're in a position to profit from volatility the lifeblood of options trading a wellplayed straddle isn't just a shot in the dark it's a calculated move it involves Keen Market observation understanding potential triggers for volatility and acting before the wave hits this proactive stance can transform uncertainty into opportunity turning the Market's mood swings into potential Profit Stream let's dive into the nitty-gritty of building your straddle picture a stock let's call it Tech genius currently at $100 per share with a major product announcement on the horizon you foresee volatility but can't predict which direction you decide to buy both a put and a call option at a $100 strike price expiring in a month if each option costs $5 your total investment is $10 this premium is your ticket to the volatility feast and the objective is clear Tech genius needs to make a significant move in either direction to cover this cost and then some and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example investing $10 in a straddle means you need tech genius to swing Beyond just covering this cost if it jumps to $15 or drops to $85 you're in profit territory this isn't about modest gains it's about about leveraging major movements for significant Returns the beauty of a straddle lies in its flexibility allowing you to profit from market dynamics while managing the inherent risk of options trading the moment of truth in a straddle strategy hinges on the Stock's performance if tech genius merely wobbles around the $100 Mark the premiums you've paid might as well be tickets to a show where the band never shows up however if it either sares with Innovation or stumbles over a scandal you're set to potentially rake in nice gains this is where your Market Insight paired with a well time straddle can shine turning volatility from a foe into a friend now visualize Tech genius defying expectations rocketing to $120 post announcement your call option is in the Limelight significantly outweighing the put options loss conversely if it tanks to $80 amid disappointment your put option becomes the star performer this Dynamic interplay underscores the straddle Essence it's not about betting on a Direction but betting on a big movement itself no strategy is without its pitfalls and straddles are no exception the key challenge ensuring the Stock's movement is sharp enough to surpass the premiums paid markets that tease with slight moves but never fully commit to a direction can erode the straddle position leaving Traders with a less than Stellar outcome it underscores the importance of strategic selection and timing and deploying this versatile yet nuanced strategy mastering straddles is akin to becoming a myestro of Market moods it involves a deep dive into market indicators understanding The Catalyst for for volatility and importantly knowing when to step back a well time stradle can be a symphony of strategic prowess mistimed it can be a costly lesson in Market humility a strangle strategy might sound complicated but it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it imagine you're at a Crossroads unsure which path to take but you know for sure that staying put isn't an option that's where the strangle strategy shines in options trading you're playing both sides of the field betting on significant movement without worrying about the direction we're talking about buying a call and put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Starbucks let's call it Cafe bucks in our fictional world it's trading at $50 by executing a long strangle you buy a $52 call and a $48 put both expiring next month if Cafe bucks either skyrockets due to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it does you're in profit territory if not well you've got your losses limited by those extra options you bought and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my Trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine you're looking at a stock let's call it future Tech currently priced at $100 you think it's not going to move much you set up your iron Condor around the belief choosing strike prices and collecting premiums up front if future Tech stays between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the money calls by expiration it's like fishing for profits in a calm sea second the short call butterfly this one's a bit more daring aiming for maximum profit when the stock price breaks free for from our set boundaries it's for those who like a bit of a Chase next we have the long put butterfly and short putut butterfly which mirror their counterparts but with puts it's like choosing between skiing or snowboarding different tools same exhilarating slope and then we have the Iron Butterfly and reverse Iron Butterfly which are the heavy metal of the group f- tuned for specific volatility forecast it's where you put your prediction skills to the ultimate test and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my Pat Pon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Tech Innovations Corp ticker tic is trading at a steady $60 using a long call butterfly spread we buy calls at $55 and $65 while selling calls at $60 if tiic stays around $60 by expiration we're in profit City but if it Strays too far from $60 well that's where our safety nets the wings minimize The Fallout the beauty of the butterfly spread lies in its balance the risks and rewards are neatly packaged with profits peaking when the market Whispers rather than it shouts but remember commissions can nibble at your gains so keep a Keen Eye on those let's kick things off with the basics imagine you're at a buffet but instead of food you've got a plethora of investment options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them as your gateway to investing in segments of the market with ease now ETF options are the Swiss army knife in your investment toolkit want to take a position on the entire Tech sector or perhaps bet on the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a whirlwind tour through the Landscapes of ETF and index options whether you're drawn to the tangible nature of ETFs or the Strategic play of index options the world is your oyster and remember our next Journey will take us into the realm of option Greeks where will unlock even more secrets to successful trading so stay tuned keep learning and let's continue to grow together keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This YouTube transcript, presented by Jerry Roman, offers a comprehensive educational overview of various options trading strategies, emphasizing that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice, with a strong focus on risk management.

options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them as your gateway to investing in segments of the market with ease now ETF options are the Swiss army knife in your investment toolkit want to take a position on the entire Tech sector or perhaps bet on the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a whirlwind tour through the Landscapes of ETF and index options whether you're drawn to the tangible nature of ETFs or the Strategic play of index options the world is your oyster and remember our next Journey will take us into the realm of option Greeks where will unlock even more secrets to successful trading so stay tuned keep learning and let's continue to grow together keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This YouTube transcript, presented by Jerry Roman, offers a comprehensive educational overview of various options trading strategies, emphasizing that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice, with a strong focus on risk management.

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains. The video is Part 2 of 2, with future content planned on ""option Greeks"" for deeper insights.",Trading view,0.9,0.7

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey folks Jerry Roman here diving into the world of stock options without the fluff this video will leave you revved up for our next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun [Music] welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your cover is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $111 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon on and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you ride a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance first off options trading it's like being given the keys to a potentially lucrative Kingdom but with great power comes great responsibility options are contracts that offer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at at a specific price on or before a certain date now while options can turbocharge your portfolio they can also be a quick way to lose money if you're not careful that's where strategies like the merried put come into play providing a safety net as you learn the ropes what is a merried put picture this you've just bought shares of your favorite stock dreaming of the profits you might make but the stock market can be unpredictable like weather in the mountains a merry put is your insurance policy ensuring that even if the stock price falls off a cliff you won't lose your shirt you purchase a put option for the same stock which allows you to sell your shares at a predetermined price no matter how far the actual price may fall it's like having an extra parachute when you're skydiving you hope you won't need it but you're glad it's there just in case and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you would like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free triy Link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's roll up our sleeves and look at a practical example suppose you buy 100 shares of a company called future Tech at $50 each to protect your investment you also buy a put option with a strike price of $45 paying a premium of $2 per share now if future Tech stock takes a nose dive to $40 your put option allows you to sell at $45 significantly reducing your loss this strategy is about minimizing risks and keeping your investment Journey on a steady course the million-dollar question when do you play this card a merried put is ideal when you're bullish on a stock but nervous about short-term risks perhaps due to Market volatility or an upcoming announcement like earnings it's particularly appealing for stocks you believe in long term but are riding through a rocky patch this strategy ensures you're part of the Stock's upside while being shielded from the worst of its downturns every insurance policy comes with a premium and married puts are no different the cost of the put option eats into your potential profits making it crucial to assess whether the protection it offers is worth a price it's about finding that sweet spot where the cost of the put aligns with the level of risk you're willing to accept remember investing is as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns is a merried put right for you incorporating merried puts into your investment strategy signals a thoughtful approach to risk management it's suited for investors who are venturing into options trading with an eye on long-term growth providing a safeguard against the markets ups and downs as you become more comfortable and experienced you'll learn when to employ this strategy to its best Advantage balancing protection with potential [Music] option spreads can seem like a complicated dance of buying and selling but think of them as your strategic moves in the options trading game both credit and debit spreads are about making these moves with precision and strategy aimed at maximizing your gains or minimizing your losses imagine you're a general plotting your next move that's what setting up a credit spread feels like it involves selling a high premium option while simultaneously buying a lower premium option the magic happens because you collect more premium from the option option you sell than what you pay for the one you buy resulting in a credit to your account for example you sell a call option with a strike price of $40 for $1 you've just netted a cool $200 setting the stage for potential profits if the spreads between these options narrow on the flip side let's say you're more of a treasure hunter seeking to uncover value with a bit of an upfront investment this is where debit spreads shine you buy an option that cost more upfront and sell another for Less spending a bit of cash or debit from your account in the hopes that you're chosen direction will pay off handsomely for instance buying a put option for $5 and selling another put option for $1 means you're betting $400 on a strategic move if the market plays in your favor this can lead to significant gains with limited risk deciding between a credit or debit spread is like choosing the right tool for the job credit spreads are your go-to in volatile markets allowing you to collect premiums and possibly benefit from time Decay debit spreads however are best when you expect moderate moves in the market letting you cap capitalize on directional Bets with limited risk I personally prefer credit spreads because you get paid when you open the position and if you do them right you're profitable if the markets are flat move in your direction or even move against you a little bit and for those

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains.

next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun [Music] welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your cover is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $111 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon on and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you ride a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance first off options trading it's like being given the keys to a potentially lucrative Kingdom but with great power comes great responsibility options are contracts that offer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at at a specific price on or before a certain date now while options can turbocharge your portfolio they can also be a quick way to lose money if you're not careful that's where strategies like the merried put come into play providing a safety net as you learn the ropes what is a merried put picture this you've just bought shares of your favorite stock dreaming of the profits you might make but the stock market can be unpredictable like weather in the mountains a merry put is your insurance policy ensuring that even if the stock price falls off a cliff you won't lose your shirt you purchase a put option for the same stock which allows you to sell your shares at a predetermined price no matter how far the actual price may fall it's like having an extra parachute when you're skydiving you hope you won't need it but you're glad it's there just in case and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you would like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free triy Link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's roll up our sleeves and look at a practical example suppose you buy 100 shares of a company called future Tech at $50 each to protect your investment you also buy a put option with a strike price of $45 paying a premium of $2 per share now if future Tech stock takes a nose dive to $40 your put option allows you to sell at $45 significantly reducing your loss this strategy is about minimizing risks and keeping your investment Journey on a steady course the million-dollar question when do you play this card a merried put is ideal when you're bullish on a stock but nervous about short-term risks perhaps due to Market volatility or an upcoming announcement like earnings it's particularly appealing for stocks you believe in long term but are riding through a rocky patch this strategy ensures you're part of the Stock's upside while being shielded from the worst of its downturns every insurance policy comes with a premium and married puts are no different the cost of the put option eats into your potential profits making it crucial to assess whether the protection it offers is worth a price it's about finding that sweet spot where the cost of the put aligns with the level of risk you're willing to accept remember investing is as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns is a merried put right for you incorporating merried puts into your investment strategy signals a thoughtful approach to risk management it's suited for investors who are venturing into options trading with an eye on long-term growth providing a safeguard against the markets ups and downs as you become more comfortable and experienced you'll learn when to employ this strategy to its best Advantage balancing protection with potential [Music] option spreads can seem like a complicated dance of buying and selling but think of them as your strategic moves in the options trading game both credit and debit spreads are about making these moves with precision and strategy aimed at maximizing your gains or minimizing your losses imagine you're a general plotting your next move that's what setting up a credit spread feels like it involves selling a high premium option while simultaneously buying a lower premium option the magic happens because you collect more premium from the option option you sell than what you pay for the one you buy resulting in a credit to your account for example you sell a call option with a strike price of $40 for $1 you've just netted a cool $200 setting the stage for potential profits if the spreads between these options narrow on the flip side let's say you're more of a treasure hunter seeking to uncover value with a bit of an upfront investment this is where debit spreads shine you buy an option that cost more upfront and sell another for Less spending a bit of cash or debit from your account in the hopes that you're chosen direction will pay off handsomely for instance buying a put option for $5 and selling another put option for $1 means you're betting $400 on a strategic move if the market plays in your favor this can lead to significant gains with limited risk deciding between a credit or debit spread is like choosing the right tool for the job credit spreads are your go-to in volatile markets allowing you to collect premiums and possibly benefit from time Decay debit spreads however are best when you expect moderate moves in the market letting you cap capitalize on directional Bets with limited risk I personally prefer credit spreads because you get paid when you open the position and if you do them right you're profitable if the markets are flat move in your direction or even move against you a little bit and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's bring this home with a fictional example we have two stocks alphatech and beta works alphatech is booming and you expect it to to rise you might Implement a bullish credit spread by selling a high premium call and buying a lower premium call on the other hand if you believe beta works is set for a slight dip a debit spread by buying a high premium put and selling a lower premium put might be your best [Music] bet the straddle is your options trading Swiss army knife imagine you're gearing up for a big football game you're not sure if it'll rain bringing a muddy slip and slide Fest or if it'll be clear skies perfect for a passing game in the stock market a stradle is akin to preparing for both outcomes it involves simultaneously purchasing a put and a call option on the same stock at the same strike price and expiring at the same time this dual action move is like having tickets to both potential plays ensuring you're set to capitalize whether the Market's mood swings high or Dives low to truly understand a straddle let's break it down a call option is your bet on the stock Rising it gives you the right to buy at a certain price conversely a put option is your hedge against a fall offering the right to sell when you straddle you're essentially saying Market do your worst or best I'm ready either way it's a powerful statement in the unpredictable world of stocks embodying the essence of being prepared for all eventualities a straddle is the strategy for an indecisive Market ever watch the market and thought it's too quiet something's Brewing that's your cue for a straddle this strategy thrives on anticipated Market trimmers be it due to earnings reports product launches or regulatory shakeups when you sense a big move but can't Peg it as good or bad straddle allows you to play Both Sides ensuring you're in a position to profit from volatility the lifeblood of options trading a wellplayed straddle isn't just a shot in the dark it's a calculated move it involves Keen Market observation understanding potential triggers for volatility and acting before the wave hits this proactive stance can transform uncertainty into opportunity turning the Market's mood swings into potential Profit Stream let's dive into the nitty-gritty of building your straddle picture a stock let's call it Tech genius currently at $100 per share with a major product announcement on the horizon you foresee volatility but can't predict which direction you decide to buy both a put and a call option at a $100 strike price expiring in a month if each option costs $5 your total investment is $10 this premium is your ticket to the volatility feast and the objective is clear Tech genius needs to make a significant move in either direction to cover this cost and then some and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example investing $10 in a straddle means you need tech genius to swing Beyond just covering this cost if it jumps to $15 or drops to $85 you're in profit territory this isn't about modest gains it's about about leveraging major movements for significant Returns the beauty of a straddle lies in its flexibility allowing you to profit from market dynamics while managing the inherent risk of options trading the moment of truth in a straddle strategy hinges on the Stock's performance if tech genius merely wobbles around the $100 Mark the premiums you've paid might as well be tickets to a show where the band never shows up however if it either sares with Innovation or stumbles over a scandal you're set to potentially rake in nice gains this is where your Market Insight paired with a well time straddle can shine turning volatility from a foe into a friend now visualize Tech genius defying expectations rocketing to $120 post announcement your call option is in the Limelight significantly outweighing the put options loss conversely if it tanks to $80 amid disappointment your put option becomes the star performer this Dynamic interplay underscores the straddle Essence it's not about betting on a Direction but betting on a big movement itself no strategy is without its pitfalls and straddles are no exception the key challenge ensuring the Stock's movement is sharp enough to surpass the premiums paid markets that tease with slight moves but never fully commit to a direction can erode the straddle position leaving Traders with a less than Stellar outcome it underscores the importance of strategic selection and timing and deploying this versatile yet nuanced strategy mastering straddles is akin to becoming a myestro of Market moods it involves a deep dive into market indicators understanding The Catalyst for for volatility and importantly knowing when to step back a well time stradle can be a symphony of strategic prowess mistimed it can be a costly lesson in Market humility a strangle strategy might sound complicated but it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it imagine you're at a Crossroads unsure which path to take but you know for sure that staying put isn't an option that's where the strangle strategy shines in options trading you're playing both sides of the field betting on significant movement without worrying about the direction we're talking about buying a call and put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Starbucks let's call it Cafe bucks in our fictional world it's trading at $50 by executing a long strangle you buy a $52 call and a $48 put both expiring next month if Cafe bucks either skyrockets due to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it does you're in profit territory if not well you've got your losses limited by those extra options you bought and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my Trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine you're looking at a stock let's call it future Tech currently priced at $100 you think it's not going to move much you set up your iron Condor around the belief choosing strike prices and collecting premiums up front if future Tech stays between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the money calls by expiration it's like fishing for profits in a calm sea second the short call butterfly this one's a bit more daring aiming for maximum profit when the stock price breaks free for from our set boundaries it's for those who like a bit of a Chase next we have the long put butterfly and short putut butterfly which mirror their counterparts but with puts it's like choosing between skiing or snowboarding different tools same exhilarating slope and then we have the Iron Butterfly and reverse Iron Butterfly which are the heavy metal of the group f- tuned for specific volatility

between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the

nets the wings minimize The Fallout the beauty of the butterfly spread lies in its balance the risks and rewards are neatly packaged with profits peaking when the market Whispers rather than it shouts but remember commissions can nibble at your gains so keep a Keen Eye on those let's kick things off with the basics imagine you're at a buffet but instead of food you've got a plethora of investment options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them as your gateway to investing in segments of the market with ease now ETF options are the Swiss army knife in your investment toolkit want to take a position on the entire Tech sector or perhaps bet on the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a whirlwind tour through the Landscapes of ETF and index options whether you're drawn to the tangible nature of ETFs or the Strategic play of index options the world is your oyster and remember our next Journey will take us into the realm of option Greeks where will unlock even more secrets to successful trading so stay tuned keep learning and let's continue to grow together keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This YouTube transcript, presented by Jerry Roman, offers a comprehensive educational overview of various options trading strategies, emphasizing that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice, with a strong focus on risk management.

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains. The video is Part 2 of 2, with future content planned on ""option Greeks"" for deeper insights.",beta works,0.2,-0.6

next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun [Music] welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your cover is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $111 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon on and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the

your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance first off options trading it's like being given the keys to a potentially lucrative Kingdom but with great power comes great responsibility options are contracts that offer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at at a specific price on or before a certain

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains.

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey folks Jerry Roman here diving into the world of stock options without the fluff this video will leave you revved up for our next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun [Music] welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your cover is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $111 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon on and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you ride a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance first off options trading it's like being given the keys to a potentially lucrative Kingdom but with great power comes great responsibility options are contracts that offer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at at a specific price on or before a certain date now while options can turbocharge your portfolio they can also be a quick way to lose money if you're not careful that's where strategies like the merried put come into play providing a safety net as you learn the ropes what is a merried put picture this you've just bought shares of your favorite stock dreaming of the profits you might make but the stock market can be unpredictable like weather in the mountains a merry put is your insurance policy ensuring that even if the stock price falls off a cliff you won't lose your shirt you purchase a put option for the same stock which allows you to sell your shares at a predetermined price no matter how far the actual price may fall it's like having an extra parachute when you're skydiving you hope you won't need it but you're glad it's there just in case and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you would like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free triy Link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's roll up our sleeves and look at a practical example suppose you buy 100 shares of a company called future Tech at $50 each to protect your investment you also buy a put option with a strike price of $45 paying a premium of $2 per share now if future Tech stock takes a nose dive to $40 your put option allows you to sell at $45 significantly reducing your loss this strategy is about minimizing risks and keeping your investment Journey on a steady course the million-dollar question when do you play this card a merried put is ideal when you're bullish on a stock but nervous about short-term risks perhaps due to Market volatility or an upcoming announcement like earnings it's particularly appealing for stocks you believe in long term but are riding through a rocky patch this strategy ensures you're part of the Stock's upside while being shielded from the worst of its downturns every insurance policy comes with a premium and married puts are no different the cost of the put option eats into your potential profits making it crucial to assess whether the protection it offers is worth a price it's about finding that sweet spot where the cost of the put aligns with the level of risk you're willing to accept remember investing is as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns is a merried put right for you incorporating merried puts into your investment strategy signals a thoughtful approach to risk management it's suited for investors who are venturing into options trading with an eye on long-term growth providing a safeguard against the markets ups and downs as you become more comfortable and experienced you'll learn when to employ this strategy to its best Advantage balancing protection with potential [Music] option spreads can seem like a complicated dance of buying and selling but think of them as your strategic moves in the options trading game both credit and debit spreads are about making these moves with precision and strategy aimed at maximizing your gains or minimizing your losses imagine you're a general plotting your next move that's what setting up a credit spread feels like it involves selling a high premium option while simultaneously buying a lower premium option the magic happens because you collect more premium from the option option you sell than what you pay for the one you buy resulting in a credit to your account for example you sell a call option with a strike price of $40 for $1 you've just netted a cool $200 setting the stage for potential profits if the spreads between these options narrow on the flip side let's say you're more of a treasure hunter seeking to uncover value with a bit of an upfront investment this is where debit spreads shine you buy an option that cost more upfront and sell another for Less spending a bit of cash or debit from your account in the hopes that you're chosen direction will pay off handsomely for instance buying a put option for $5 and selling another put option for $1 means you're betting $400 on a strategic move if the market plays in your favor this can lead to significant gains with limited risk deciding between a credit or debit spread is like choosing the right tool for the job credit spreads are your go-to in volatile markets allowing you to collect premiums and possibly benefit from time Decay debit spreads however are best when you expect moderate moves in the market letting you cap capitalize on directional Bets with limited risk I personally prefer credit spreads because you get paid when you open the position and if you do them right you're profitable if the markets are flat move in your direction or even move against you a little bit and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's bring this home with a fictional example we have two stocks alphatech and beta works alphatech is booming and you expect it to to rise you might Implement a bullish credit spread by selling a high premium call and buying a lower premium call on the other hand if you believe beta works is set for a slight dip a debit spread by buying a high premium put and selling a lower premium put might be your best [Music] bet the straddle is your options trading Swiss army knife imagine you're gearing up for a big football game you're not sure if it'll rain bringing a muddy slip and slide Fest or if it'll be clear skies perfect for a passing game in the stock market a stradle is akin to preparing for both outcomes it involves simultaneously purchasing a put and a call option on the same stock at the same strike price and expiring at the same time this dual action move is like having tickets to both potential plays ensuring you're set to capitalize whether the Market's mood swings high or Dives low to truly understand a straddle let's break it down a call option is your bet on the stock Rising it gives you the right to buy at a certain price conversely a put option is your hedge against a fall offering the right to sell when you straddle you're essentially saying Market do your worst or best I'm ready either way it's a powerful statement in the unpredictable world of stocks embodying the essence of being prepared for all eventualities a straddle is the strategy for an indecisive Market ever watch the market and thought it's too quiet something's Brewing that's your cue for a straddle this strategy thrives on anticipated Market trimmers be it due to earnings reports product launches or regulatory shakeups when you sense a big move but can't Peg it as good or bad straddle allows you to play Both Sides ensuring you're in a position to profit from volatility the lifeblood of options trading a wellplayed straddle isn't just a shot in the dark it's a calculated move it involves Keen Market observation understanding potential triggers for volatility and acting before the wave hits this proactive stance can transform uncertainty into opportunity turning the Market's mood swings into potential Profit Stream let's dive into the nitty-gritty of building your straddle picture a stock let's call it Tech genius currently at $100 per share with a major product announcement on the horizon you foresee volatility but can't predict which direction you decide to buy both a put and a call option at a $100 strike price expiring in a month if each option costs $5 your total investment is $10 this premium is your ticket to the volatility feast and the objective is clear Tech genius needs to make a significant move in either direction to cover this cost and then some and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example investing $10 in a straddle means you need tech genius to swing Beyond just covering this cost if it jumps to $15 or drops to $85 you're in profit territory this isn't about modest gains it's about about leveraging major movements for significant Returns the beauty of a straddle lies in its flexibility allowing you to profit from market dynamics while managing the inherent risk of options trading the moment of truth in a straddle strategy hinges on the Stock's performance if tech genius merely wobbles around the $100 Mark the premiums you've paid might as well be tickets to a show where the band never shows up however if it either sares with Innovation or stumbles over a scandal you're set to potentially rake in nice gains this is where your Market Insight paired with a well time straddle can shine turning volatility from a foe into a friend now visualize Tech genius defying expectations rocketing to $120 post announcement your call option is in the Limelight significantly outweighing the put options loss conversely if it tanks to $80 amid disappointment your put option becomes the star performer this Dynamic interplay underscores the straddle Essence it's not about betting on a Direction but betting on a big movement itself no strategy is without its pitfalls and straddles are no exception the key challenge ensuring the Stock's movement is sharp enough to surpass the premiums paid markets that tease with slight moves but never fully commit to a direction can erode the straddle position leaving Traders with a less than Stellar outcome it underscores the importance of strategic selection and timing and deploying this versatile yet nuanced strategy mastering straddles is akin to becoming a myestro of Market moods it involves a deep dive into market indicators understanding The Catalyst for for volatility and importantly knowing when to step back a well time stradle can be a symphony of strategic prowess mistimed it can be a costly lesson in Market humility a strangle strategy might sound complicated but it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it imagine you're at a Crossroads unsure which path to take but you know for sure that staying put isn't an option that's where the strangle strategy shines in options trading you're playing both sides of the field betting on significant movement without worrying about the direction we're talking about buying a call and put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Starbucks let's call it Cafe bucks in our fictional world it's trading at $50 by executing a long strangle you buy a $52 call and a $48 put both expiring next month if Cafe bucks either skyrockets due to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it

between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss

this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where

imagine you're at a Crossroads unsure which path to take but you know for sure that staying put isn't an option that's where the strangle strategy shines in options trading you're playing both sides of the field betting on significant movement without worrying about the direction we're talking about buying a call and put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give

to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it does you're in profit territory if not well you've got your losses limited by those extra options you bought and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if

future Tech currently priced at $100 you think it's not going to move much you set up your iron Condor around the belief choosing strike prices and collecting premiums up front if future Tech stays between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the money calls by expiration it's like fishing for profits in a calm sea second the short call butterfly this one's a bit more daring aiming for maximum profit when the stock price breaks free for from our set boundaries it's for those who like a bit of a Chase next we have the long put butterfly and short putut butterfly which mirror their counterparts but with puts it's like choosing between skiing or snowboarding different tools same exhilarating slope and then we have the Iron Butterfly and reverse Iron Butterfly which are the heavy metal of the group f- tuned for specific volatility

call butterfly spread we buy calls at $55 and $65 while selling calls at $60 if tiic stays around $60 by expiration we're in profit City but if it Strays too far from $60 well that's where our safety nets the wings minimize The Fallout the beauty of the butterfly spread lies in its balance the risks and rewards are neatly packaged with profits peaking when the market Whispers rather than it shouts but remember commissions can nibble at your gains so keep a Keen Eye on those let's kick things off with the basics imagine you're at a buffet but instead of food you've got a plethora of investment options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them as your gateway to investing in segments of the market with ease now ETF options are the Swiss army knife in your investment toolkit want to take a position on the entire Tech sector or perhaps bet on the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a whirlwind tour through the Landscapes of ETF and index options whether you're drawn to the tangible nature of ETFs or the Strategic play of index options the world is your oyster and remember our next Journey will take us into the realm of option Greeks where will unlock even more secrets to successful trading so stay tuned keep learning and let's continue to grow together keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This YouTube transcript, presented by Jerry Roman, offers a comprehensive educational overview of various options trading strategies, emphasizing that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice, with a strong focus on risk management.

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains. The video is Part 2 of 2, with future content planned on ""option Greeks"" for deeper insights.",Cafe bucks,0.2,0.0

same expiration date let's cover a long strangle which is what I call the adventurer's choice let's say you're feeling adventurous and decided to go long with your strangle this means you'll buy an out-of- the- money call hoping the asset will climb and an out-of- the money put hedging your benefit falls the beauty your profit potential is unlimited if the asset decides to sprint in either direction making it an exciting strategy for those who believe big news or Market moves are on the horizon now a short strangle or playing it safe is not Everyone likes living on the edge though for a more reserved approach there's the short strangle where you sell both an out-of-the money call and put this strategy bets on the market chilling within a range offering profit from premiums as long as the asset doesn't break out from its comfort zone it's a bit like collecting toll fees on a quiet Highway less thrilling but money is money and for for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Starbucks let's call it Cafe bucks in our fictional world it's trading at $50 by executing a long strangle you buy a $52 call and a $48 put both expiring next month if Cafe bucks either skyrockets due to a revolutionary latte launch or plummets because of an espresso Scandal you're set to make significant profits provided the move is strong enough to cover your initial cost this strategy is about catching big waves not paddling in the kitty pool calculating your break even the path to profit navigating the strangle strategy means knowing your break even points it's simple math add your total premium spent to the call strike for the upside break even and subtract it from the put strike for the downside your mission hope for a move Beyond these markers mastering the strangle is the beginning as we wrap up remember the goal here isn't to just understand but to use these strategies to navigate the markets with confidence next time we'll explore the iron Condor another fantastic beast in the option strategy Zoo offering insights for season Traders and newcomers alike stay tuned stay curious and always happy [Music] trading let's start with the basics and iron Condor is a strategy in options trading where you use four different options to capture profit from a stock or asset that's not expected to move much it's like setting up a net to catch profits whether the market moves up a little or down a little the beauty of it you limit your risks while setting clear boundaries for where you make your money constructing an iron Condor might sound like you need an engineering degree but it's actually straightforward you sell a call and put option at the middle strike prices close to the current price of the stock then you buy a call and a put option further out to cap your losses it's a balancing act ensuring your losses are controlled while opening up for profits in a stable market now how do we make money and what's our risk your max profit is the premium you get from setting up the trade it's your reward for being the middleman the catch your potential loss is CA too but it's there it all boils down to the stock staying within your chosen range if it does you're in profit territory if not well you've got your losses limited by those extra options you bought and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my Trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine you're looking at a stock let's call it future Tech currently priced at $100 you think it's not going to move much you set up your iron Condor around the belief choosing strike prices and collecting premiums up front if future Tech stays between your strike prices until expiration you keep those premiums as profit it's like placing a bet on stability with the odds in your favor [Music] first off a butterfly spread is like the Swiss army knife of option strategies it combines the power of Bull and Bear spreads into one offering a safety net with fixed risks and capped profits ideal for those who prefer a market neutral stance this strategy shines brightest when the underlying asset remains stable at its core the butterfly spread involves four options and three different strike prices picture this two wings and a body where the body is at the money and the wings are equidistant from the central Point whether you're playing with calls puts or a mix the setup is designed to cater to your speculation on volatility or lack thereof now let's Savor the different flavors of butterfly spreads first the long call butterfly think of it as setting up a net where the maximum profit lands if the stock hovers around your at the money calls by expiration it's like fishing for profits in a calm sea second the short call butterfly this one's a bit more daring aiming for maximum profit when the stock price breaks free for from our set boundaries it's for those who like a bit of a Chase next we have the long put butterfly and short putut butterfly which mirror their counterparts but with puts it's like choosing between skiing or snowboarding different tools same exhilarating slope and then we have the Iron Butterfly and reverse Iron Butterfly which are the heavy metal of the group f- tuned for specific volatility forecast it's where you put your prediction skills to the ultimate test and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my Pat Pon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine Tech Innovations Corp ticker tic is trading at a steady $60 using a long call butterfly spread we buy calls at $55 and $65 while selling calls at $60 if tiic stays around $60 by expiration we're in profit City but if it Strays too far from $60 well that's where our safety nets the wings minimize The Fallout the beauty of the butterfly spread lies in its balance the risks and rewards are neatly packaged with profits peaking when the market Whispers rather than it shouts but remember commissions can nibble at your gains so keep a Keen Eye on those let's kick things off with the basics imagine you're at a buffet but instead of food you've got a plethora of investment options two dishes catch your eye ETF options and index options ETF options much like a carefully crafted dish are tied to an exchang traded fund trading like a stock throughout the day think of them as your gateway to investing in segments of the market with ease now ETF options are the Swiss army knife in your investment toolkit want to take a position on the entire Tech sector or perhaps bet on the rise of Emerging Markets ETF options have got you covered allowing you to trade based on your Market predictions and the best part there is straightforward to buy and sell as your favorite stock settling in actual shares of the ETF transition ing the index options these are like betting on the outcome of the entire game rather than the individual players with no direct trading on the underlying index they offer a way to speculate on market trends or head your bets across a broad portfolio remember though index options are settled in cash making them a different beast from ETF options and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example here's where the plot Pickens unlike ETF options which settle in shares and can be exercised at any point index options are more like a gentleman's agreement settling in cash when the time comes this means no early exercises and surprises it's a pivotal difference that can influence your strategy and how you manage your trades as we venture into the crossroads deciding between ETF and index options isn't about which is better but which is right for you are you aiming for a straightforward trade with shares or do you prefer prer the Elegance of a cash settlement understanding the volume and liquidity of your options can also guide your path ensuring your trades are as smooth as a good old bourbon and there you have it folks a whirlwind tour through the Landscapes of ETF and index options whether you're drawn to the tangible nature of ETFs or the Strategic play of index options the world is your oyster and remember our next Journey will take us into the realm of option Greeks where will unlock even more secrets to successful trading so stay tuned keep learning and let's continue to grow together keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This YouTube transcript, presented by Jerry Roman, offers a comprehensive educational overview of various options trading strategies, emphasizing that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice, with a strong focus on risk management.

Key strategies discussed include:
*   **Covered Calls:** For ""cautious optimists"" owning shares, generating income while capping upside.
*   **Married Puts:** An ""insurance policy"" for long-term bullish investors concerned about short-term volatility, minimizing downside risk at a cost.
*   **Option Spreads (Credit & Debit):** Strategic tools to manage risk and reward. Credit spreads (speaker's preference, especially in volatile markets) collect upfront premiums, while Debit spreads capitalize on moderate directional moves with limited risk.
*   **Straddles:** Ideal for ""indecisive markets"" anticipating significant volatility (e.g., earnings) without a directional bias.
*   **Strangles (Long & Short):** Similar to straddles but with different strike prices; Long Strangles (""Adventurer's choice"") profit from large moves in any direction, while Short Strangles (""Playing it safe"") bet on the market staying within a defined range.
*   **Iron Condor:** Designed for capturing profit in stable, range-bound markets with limited profit and loss.
*   **Butterfly Spread:** A ""market neutral"" strategy for stable assets, offering fixed risks and capped profits.

The video also distinguishes between **ETF Options** (settle in shares, for market segments) and **Index Options** (cash-settled, for broader market trends or hedging). While options can ""turbocharge your portfolio,"" the speaker cautions they can also lead to quick losses if not managed carefully, highlighting that investing is ""as much about managing risks as it is about seeking returns,"" and commissions can erode gains. The video is Part 2 of 2, with future content planned on ""option Greeks"" for deeper insights.",Tech Innovations Corp,0.2,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en have you ever wondered if a million dollars is still enough to retire on with inflation Rising living costs and Market volatility it's a question that weighs heavily on many Minds what if I told you there's a way to make that dream a reality regardless of where you are today in this video I'm going to break down a strategy that could help you retire comfortably even in today's challenging Financial landscape this might sound too good to be true but stick around and I'll show you how achievable it really is your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one common ways to gauge retirement savings number two a simple four-step investment plan for $1 million number three real life application and potential income from covered calls and number four addressing concerns and realistic expectations [Music] are you dreaming of the day your investment income can finally set you free from your 9 to-5 grind well that day might be closer than you think today I'm tackling the question of whether $1 million invested properly is still enough to retire comfortably I recently read the article I retired in my 30s with a net worth of $2.5 million over a decade ago now I'm going back to work at 46 and long story short this guy is living in San Francisco and he now has two kids and is going back to work because his 2.5 million was no longer supporting his expensive San Fran lifestyle and let's face it $1 million today isn't what it used to be I'm already retired and my partner and I live like kings on less than $1,500 per month in Thailand so moving to Thailand is one option but let's be real most of you don't want to move to make your retirement dreams come true so today we're going to dive deep into how you could invest $1 million and how much money you could reasonably expect to earn and if you can please like and comment on this video it will help ensure the right person sees it and the next person could be a friend or someone you love and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time alerts in my patreon and if you want to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below let's cover three common ways to gauge retirement savings number one is called the final multiple with this method you aim for 10 to 12 times your annual income at retirement age if you plan to retire at 67 and your income is $150,000 per year you should have between $ 1.5 and $1.8 million set aside this approach is straightforward especially as you get closer to retirement when your final annual compensation is easier to estimate number two is What's called the pacing angle here the goal is to save a multiple of your annual income at various stages by age 30 aim for the equivalent of your current annual income by age 40 aim for three times your income and by retirement age aim for 10 10 to 12 times your income to ensure you have enough funds number three is the seamless transition this approach suggests having roughly 80% of your pre-retirement income based on a safe withdrawal rate of about 4% this amount ensures you will have retirement income for approximately 25 years combined with Social Security a net worth above $1 million can help you meet your financial needs in retirement and now let's go through the four steps and I'm going to use numbers from the actual market today but remember this is a hypothetical example step number one we're going to put $500,000 in the triple Q or triple qm which is the NASDAQ 100 historically the triple Q has averaged a 14.4% compound annual return over the last 30 years in the last 10 years it has averaged 18.27% let's run with a 30-year average of 14.4% this generates a $72,000 annual return while you could spend that 72,000 every year my suggestion is to put 500,000 in the triple q and not touch it this is our conservative money and a large Nest Egg to fall back on if needed our Step One summary is pretty easy we're going to just put 500,000 in the triple Q reinvest the dividends and simply Let It Grow and build over time step number two we're going to put $167,600 applications positioning it for extreme growth since our goal is to generate income Let's ignore the stock appreciation and focus on income through covered calls now writing covered calls involves holding a long position in a stock and selling call options on that same stock to generate additional income this provides premium income from the sale of call options cushioning against potential stock price declines as of today Nvidia is currently selling for $129.60 per share if we buy $167,600 $66 of Nvidia will have 1,293 shares this will allow us to sell 12 weekly covered calls and I recommend selling with a Delta around 0.25 and right now we've got a 0.22 Delta which would generate approximately $1,140 of income per week the estimated monthly income would be $4,940 and the estimated annual income $59,800 to really grasp these numbers pause the screen and check out my free option analyzer at beast mode analysis.com I know I'm covering things quickly but my option analyzer simplifies understanding options and your returns plus it lets you track your positions to know your real numbers for step number three we're going to put another 167,000 into paler and write covered calls paler is a leader in Ai and big data analytics and I believe they are positioned for significant growth over the next few years following the same covered call strategies with Nvidia we'll focus on income generation today paler is trading at 2327 so that would buy approximately 7,25 shares now that's going to let us sell 72 covered calls with a Delta at 020 we would generate approximately $1,080 of income per week the estimated monthly income will be $4,680 the estimated annual income $56,950 and for step four we're going to put the final $167,000 in change into Tesla and write more covered calls now Tesla has had a terrible year but I'm still bullish on Tesla for the long term if you don't like Tesla then pick a stock you love that better suits your investment style now Tesla is currently trading at $182 47 and buying 167,000 would buy approximately 918 shares and we're going to sell nine weekly covered calls with a Delta at .24 which would generate approximately $1,935 of income per week the estimated monthly income $8 $385 and the estimated annual income $1,620 now I know some of you are haters so let me share my actual numbers from Tesla from this week my real weekly income from Tesla covered calls is $4,975 my estimated monthly income from Tesla $2,564 and my estimated annual income from Tesla covered calls $258,700 now despite Tesla's 40% decline this year I've not had any Tesla stocks called away and I still generate great income from my covered calls plus as the stock recovers My overall profits will increase now you might be wondering why my Tesla numbers are lower than the example there's a few reasons number one Tesla just approved elon's Compensation Plan yesterday so the premiums and volatility jumped and they're higher than when I sold my covered calls last week and number two I normally sell about a 0.10 Delta on Tesla which means I'm very conservative ative and I make much less than if I sold the 0.25 Delta now I do this because Tesla is very volatile and my goal is to keep the stock longterm in other words I don't want to have it called away I have a good life and I don't need to squeeze every nickel out of every trade so the 0.10 Delta works for me but you'll want to invest in a way that meets your needs and comfort levels next let's review our overall numbers from selling covered calls on Invidia paler and Tesla the estimated weekly income is $415 the estimated monthly income is $1,526 60 now including the $72,000 of annual income from the triple Q the total estimated annual income is $288,700 now let's talk about realistic expectations there will be good and bad days weeks and months in the stock market the numbers shown are based on current market conditions and some weeks will make more and other weeks less for the sake of argument let's cut our covered call income in half so instead of making $26,670 that's actually a very realistic number with our covered call strategy and don't forget we'll make a lot more if the stocks appreciate as expected over the long term and remember the $188,000 does not include the $500,000 we have in the triple Q or the profits from the triple Q so here's the big question do you think you could live off of 108,000 to 216,00 per year now I really encourage you to pick a few stocks you like and run your own numbers I'm living the dream over here in Thailand and I sell covered calls every week my patrons and I know what can be done because we're doing it every week now here's my conclusion the belief that you need a massive Fortune to retire is not true and I really hope that today's video shows it's possible to retire with just $1 million today I gave you a plan to consider where we invested the first 500,000 into the triple Q for lowrisk growth and use the remaining $500,000 in Nvidia paler and Tesla to generate significant income through covered calls the numbers don't lie I really hope today's video is giving you something to think about selling covered calls is a low-risk option strategy that can help you realize your financial goals and maybe even retire with just $1 million keep it real and I'll see you in the next video","The video challenges the perception that $1 million is insufficient for retirement due to rising costs, with speaker Jerry asserting it is indeed possible to retire comfortably using a specific investment strategy.

While traditional retirement planning often involves targeting 10-12 times annual income or an 80% pre-retirement income replacement based on a 4% withdrawal rate, Jerry proposes a four-step plan for a $1 million portfolio:

1.  **Long-Term Growth ($500,000 in QQQ/QQQM):** Half the portfolio is allocated to the NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQ or QQQM). This capital is designated as a ""large Nest Egg"" for long-term growth, with dividends reinvested, and is not intended for immediate spending, leveraging QQQ's historical average compound annual return of 14.4% over 30 years.
2.  **Income Generation via Covered Calls ($500,000 across Nvidia, Palantir, and Tesla):** The remaining $500,000 is split among three individual stocks (Nvidia, Palantir, Tesla) to generate consistent income through selling weekly covered calls (typically Delta 0.20-0.25). Nvidia and Palantir are selected for their leadership in AI and data analytics, while Tesla is chosen for its long-term growth potential despite recent volatility. This ""low-risk option strategy"" provides premium income and offers some downside protection.

Jerry acknowledges the diminishing purchasing power of $1 million in high-cost areas but demonstrates the strategy's viability by contrasting it with his personal, low-cost lifestyle funded by covered call income in Thailand. For realistic expectations, he suggests a conservative annual income target of $108,000 (half of the estimated $216,000 gross covered call income), emphasizing that this figure does not include potential appreciation from the QQQ portion. He concludes that by applying this strategic allocation and income generation method, retiring with $1 million is achievable.",Nvidia,1.0,1.0

Fortune to retire is not true and I really hope that today's video shows it's possible to retire with just $1 million today I gave you a plan to consider where we invested the first 500,000 into the triple Q for lowrisk growth and use the remaining $500,000 in Nvidia paler and Tesla to generate significant income through covered calls the numbers don't lie I really hope today's video is giving you something to think about selling covered calls is a low-risk option strategy that can help you realize your financial goals and maybe even retire with just $1 million keep it real and I'll see you in the next video","The video challenges the perception that $1 million is insufficient for retirement due to rising costs, with speaker Jerry asserting it is indeed possible to retire comfortably using a specific investment strategy.

While traditional retirement planning often involves targeting 10-12 times annual income or an 80% pre-retirement income replacement based on a 4% withdrawal rate, Jerry proposes a four-step plan for a $1 million portfolio:

1.  **Long-Term Growth ($500,000 in QQQ/QQQM):** Half the portfolio is allocated to the NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQ or QQQM). This capital is designated as a ""large Nest Egg"" for long-term growth, with dividends reinvested, and is not intended for immediate spending, leveraging QQQ's historical average compound annual return of 14.4% over 30 years.
2.  **Income Generation via Covered Calls ($500,000 across Nvidia, Palantir, and Tesla):** The remaining $500,000 is split among three individual stocks (Nvidia, Palantir, Tesla) to generate consistent income through selling weekly covered calls (typically Delta 0.20-0.25). Nvidia and Palantir are selected for their leadership in AI and data analytics, while Tesla is chosen for its long-term growth potential despite recent volatility. This ""low-risk option strategy"" provides premium income and offers some downside protection.

Jerry acknowledges the diminishing purchasing power of $1 million in high-cost areas but demonstrates the strategy's viability by contrasting it with his personal, low-cost lifestyle funded by covered call income in Thailand. For realistic expectations, he suggests a conservative annual income target of $108,000 (half of the estimated $216,000 gross covered call income), emphasizing that this figure does not include potential appreciation from the QQQ portion. He concludes that by applying this strategic allocation and income generation method, retiring with $1 million is achievable.",Palantir,1.0,1.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en have you ever wondered if a million dollars is still enough to retire on with inflation Rising living costs and Market volatility it's a question that weighs heavily on many Minds what if I told you there's a way to make that dream a reality regardless of where you are today in this video I'm going to break down a strategy that could help you retire comfortably even in today's challenging Financial landscape this might sound too good to be true but stick around and I'll show you how achievable it really is your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one common ways to gauge retirement savings number two a simple four-step investment plan for $1 million number three real life application and potential income from covered calls and number four addressing concerns and realistic expectations [Music] are you dreaming of the day your investment income can finally set you free from your 9 to-5 grind well that day might be closer than you think today I'm tackling the question of whether $1 million invested properly is still enough to retire comfortably I recently read the article I retired in my 30s with a net worth of $2.5 million over a decade ago now I'm going back to work at 46 and long story short this guy is living in San Francisco and he now has two kids and is going back to work because his 2.5 million was no longer supporting his expensive San Fran lifestyle and let's face it $1 million today isn't what it used to be I'm already retired and my partner and I live like kings on less than $1,500 per month in Thailand so moving to Thailand is one option but let's be real most of you don't want to move to make your retirement dreams come true so today we're going to dive deep into how you could invest $1 million and how much money you could reasonably expect to earn and if you can please like and comment on this video it will help ensure the right person sees it and the next person could be a friend or someone you love and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time alerts in my patreon and if you want to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below let's cover three common ways to gauge retirement savings number one is called the final multiple with this method you aim for 10 to 12 times your annual income at retirement age if you plan to retire at 67 and your income is $150,000 per year you should have between $ 1.5 and $1.8 million set aside this approach is straightforward especially as you get closer to retirement when your final annual compensation is easier to estimate number two is What's called the pacing angle here the goal is to save a multiple of your annual income at various stages by age 30 aim for the equivalent of your current annual income by age 40 aim for three times your income and by retirement age aim for 10 10 to 12 times your income to ensure you have enough funds number three is the seamless transition this approach suggests having roughly 80% of your pre-retirement income based on a safe withdrawal rate of about 4% this amount ensures you will have retirement income for approximately 25 years combined with Social Security a net worth above $1 million can help you meet your financial needs in retirement and now let's go through the four steps and I'm going to use numbers from the actual market today but remember this is a hypothetical example step number one we're going to put $500,000 in the triple Q or triple qm which is the NASDAQ 100 historically the triple Q has averaged a 14.4% compound annual return over the last 30 years in the last 10 years it has averaged 18.27% let's run with a 30-year average of 14.4% this generates a $72,000 annual return while you could spend that 72,000 every year my suggestion is to put 500,000 in the triple q and not touch it this is our conservative money and a large Nest Egg to fall back on if needed our Step One summary is pretty easy we're going to just put 500,000 in the triple Q reinvest the dividends and simply Let It Grow and build over time step number two we're going to put $167,600 applications positioning it for extreme growth since our goal is to generate income Let's ignore the stock appreciation and focus on income through covered calls now writing covered calls involves holding a long position in a stock and selling call options on that same stock to generate additional income this provides premium income from the sale of call options cushioning against potential stock price declines as of today Nvidia is currently selling for $129.60 per share if we buy $167,600 $66 of Nvidia will have 1,293 shares this will allow us to sell 12 weekly covered calls and I recommend selling with a Delta around 0.25 and right now we've got a 0.22 Delta which would generate approximately $1,140 of income per week the estimated monthly income would be $4,940 and the estimated annual income $59,800 to really grasp these numbers pause the screen and check out my free option analyzer at beast mode analysis.com I know I'm covering things quickly but my option analyzer simplifies understanding options and your returns plus it lets you track your positions to know your real numbers for step number three we're going to put another 167,000 into paler and write covered calls paler is a leader in Ai and big data analytics and I believe they are positioned for significant growth over the next few years following the same covered call strategies with Nvidia we'll focus on income generation today paler is trading at 2327 so that would buy approximately 7,25 shares now that's going to let us sell 72 covered calls with a Delta at 020 we would generate approximately $1,080 of income per week the estimated monthly income will be $4,680 the estimated annual income $56,950 and for step four we're going to put the final $167,000 in change into Tesla and write more covered calls now Tesla has had a terrible year but I'm still bullish on Tesla for the long term if you don't like Tesla then pick a stock you love that better suits your investment style now Tesla is currently trading at $182 47 and buying 167,000 would buy approximately 918 shares and we're going to sell nine weekly covered calls with a Delta at .24 which would generate approximately $1,935 of income per week the estimated monthly income $8 $385 and the estimated annual income $1,620 now I know some of you are haters so let me share my actual numbers from Tesla from this week my real weekly income from Tesla covered calls is $4,975 my estimated monthly income from Tesla $2,564 and my estimated annual income from Tesla covered calls $258,700 now despite Tesla's 40% decline this year I've not had any Tesla stocks called away and I still generate great income from my covered calls plus as the stock recovers My overall profits will increase now you might be wondering why my Tesla numbers are lower than the example there's a few reasons number one Tesla just approved elon's Compensation Plan yesterday so the premiums and volatility jumped and they're higher than when I sold my covered calls last week and number two I normally sell about a 0.10 Delta on Tesla which means I'm very conservative ative and I make much less than if I sold the 0.25 Delta now I do this because Tesla is very volatile and my goal is to keep the stock longterm in other words I don't want to have it called away I have a good life and I don't need to squeeze every nickel out of every trade so the 0.10 Delta works for me but you'll want to invest in a way that meets your needs and comfort levels next let's review our overall numbers from selling covered calls on Invidia paler and Tesla the estimated weekly income is $415 the estimated monthly income is $1,526 60 now including the $72,000 of annual income from the triple Q the total estimated annual income is $288,700 now let's talk about realistic expectations there will be good and bad days weeks and months in the stock market the numbers shown are based on current market conditions and some weeks will make more and other weeks less for the sake of argument let's cut our covered call income in half so instead of making $26,670 that's actually a very realistic number with our covered call strategy and don't forget we'll make a lot more if the stocks appreciate as expected over the long term and remember the $188,000 does not include the $500,000 we have in the triple Q or the profits from the triple Q so here's the big question do you think you could live off of 108,000 to 216,00 per year now I really encourage you to pick a few stocks you like and run your own numbers I'm living the dream over here in Thailand and I sell covered calls every week my patrons and I know what can be done because we're doing it every week now here's my conclusion the belief that you need a massive Fortune to retire is not true and I really hope that today's video shows it's possible to retire with just $1 million today I gave you a plan to consider where we invested the first 500,000 into the triple Q for lowrisk growth and use the remaining $500,000 in Nvidia paler and Tesla to generate significant income through covered calls the numbers don't lie I really hope today's video is giving you something to think about selling covered calls is a low-risk option strategy that can help you realize your financial goals and maybe even retire with just $1 million keep it real and I'll see you

spot this is not just about making Investments it's about making smart moves that can amplify your financial prowess whether you're a beginner or looking to hone your stock skills stick around let's unlock the secrets together [Music] a call option isn't just a financial term it's your secret weapon in the investment Battlefield think of it as a Golden Ticket allowing you to buy an asset at a predetermined price within a set time frame this isn't about being bound to buy it's about having the option to buy when the Price Is Right leveraging your position to maximize gains when while your risk is limited to the price paid for the option the premium it's smart investing Made Simple you harness the power of market trends to secure profits while shielding yourself from bigger losses call

Market upswings or a short call to generate income or protect your portfolio each strategy offers distinct advantages the art lies in choosing your strategy based on your Market Outlook and investment goals from speculative plays to hedging tactics call options provide a flexible toolkit for navigating the financial markets with precision and confidence the true value of call options is

movements for higher returns and offer a safety net during downturns by integrating call options into your investment strategies you equip yourself with the tools to manage and enhance your financial portfolio actively embarking on mastering call options is about blending Theory with practice it starts with a solid grasp of fundamental principles and evolves into applying these insights to

staying attuned to market dynamics are crucial as you advance your skills and strategies at options trading and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time Decay and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below and now for some fun The Three Musketeers of options are in the money itm at the money ATM and out of the money motm each with its own character and role in your trading strategy in the money options are your Valiant Athos reliable and strong offering intrinsic value from the get-go because the stock price has already moved beyond the strike price in your favor they're the safer bet sporting a higher price for their inherent value akin to playing for a guaranteed view in a high-rise Hotel you're paying Upfront for the scenery you know you'll get yet their safety comes with a cost a higher premium reflecting their likelihood to end profitably on the other flank we have the daring aramas the otm options with no intrinsic value at the outset but holding a promise of considerable profit should the market swing your way these are the high-risk High reward plays akin to betting on a dark horse in a race their premiums are lower making them accessible but they require a sharp Market upter to breach their strike price and come into profit and then there's poros the at the money option standing bravely at the threshold where the stock price and the strike price meet they repres present a balance of risk and potential their value tied closely to how the market breathes in the short term for Traders they offer a middle ground a blend of potential profitability and risk [Music] management first off what is an option premium think of it like the price tag on your ability to either buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date it's what you pay upfront and it's determined by a mix of factors we're about to explore this concept is the Cornerstone of trading options and understanding it is your first step towards mastering options trading now let's dissect an option premium it consists of intrinsic value that's the actual tangible value if you exercise the option right now and then there's extrinsic value which is a bit more like betting on the Future IT factors in the time left on the option and the stocks volatility together these create the full price of the option blending the real with the what could be so what's driving the option price imagine you're shopping for a car the price changes based on the model features and even the Demand right similarly the price of an option premium is influenced by the Stock's current price how close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're willing to pay let's focus on time and volatility for a moment think of time as an ice cube sitting in the sun it's slowly melting away that's your options time value diminishing as you approach the expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up let's walk you through an example and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's get into it imagine we're looking at the made company called future Tech it's a burgeoning tech firm with rumors of a groundbreaking product on the horizon you've been keeping an eye on this company believing it stock price is set to soar once the product is launched to capitalize on this potential uptick you decide to buy a call option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",ABC stock,0.1,0.5

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time

close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're willing to pay let's focus on time and volatility for a moment think of time as an ice cube sitting in the sun it's slowly melting away that's your options time value diminishing as you approach the expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up let's walk you through an example and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's get into it imagine we're looking at the made company called future Tech it's a burgeoning tech firm with rumors of a groundbreaking product on the horizon you've been keeping an eye on this company believing it stock price is set to soar once the product is launched to capitalize on this potential uptick you decide to buy a call option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",XYZ company,0.1,0.0

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time

expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up let's walk you through an example and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's get into it imagine we're looking at the made company called future Tech it's a burgeoning tech firm with rumors of a groundbreaking product on the horizon you've been keeping an eye on this company believing it stock price is set to soar once the product is launched to capitalize on this potential uptick you decide to buy a call option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",Future Tech,0.2,0.7

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time

option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",Tech Innovations,0.2,0.7

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time

dissect an option premium it consists of intrinsic value that's the actual tangible value if you exercise the option right now and then there's extrinsic value which is a bit more like betting on the Future IT factors in the time left on the option and the stocks volatility together these create the full price of the option blending the real with the what could be so what's driving the option price imagine you're shopping for a car the price changes based on the model features and even the Demand right similarly the price of an option premium is influenced by the Stock's current price how close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're

intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",Gadget World,0.2,0.6

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time Decay and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below and

balance of risk and potential their value tied closely to how the market breathes in the short term for Traders they offer a middle ground a blend of potential profitability and risk [Music] management first off what is an option premium think of it like the price tag on your ability to either buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date it's what you pay upfront and it's determined by a mix of factors we're about to explore this concept is the Cornerstone of trading options and understanding it is your first step towards mastering options trading now let's dissect an option premium it consists of intrinsic value that's the actual tangible value if you exercise the option right now and then there's extrinsic value which is a bit more like betting on the Future IT factors in the time left on the option and the stocks volatility together these create the full price of the option blending the real with the what could be so what's driving the option price imagine you're shopping for a car the price changes based on the model features and even the Demand right similarly the price of an option premium is influenced by the Stock's current price how close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're willing to pay let's focus on time and volatility for a moment think of time as an ice cube sitting in the sun it's slowly melting away that's your options time value diminishing as you approach the expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up

option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",Patreon,0.7,0.3

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time Decay and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below and

breach their strike price and come into profit and then there's poros the at the money option standing bravely at the threshold where the stock price and the strike price meet they repres present a balance of risk and potential their value tied closely to how the market breathes in the short term for Traders they offer a middle ground a blend of potential profitability and risk [Music] management first off what is an option premium think of it like the price tag on your ability to either buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date it's what you pay upfront and it's determined by a mix of factors we're about to explore this concept is the Cornerstone of trading options and understanding it is your first step towards mastering options trading now let's dissect an option premium it consists of intrinsic value that's the actual tangible value if you exercise the option right now and then there's extrinsic value which is a bit more like betting on the Future IT factors in the time left on the option and the stocks volatility together these create the full price of the option blending the real with the what could be so what's driving the option price imagine you're shopping for a car the price changes based on the model features and even the Demand right similarly the price of an option premium is influenced by the Stock's current price how close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're willing to pay let's focus on time and volatility for a moment think of time as an ice cube sitting in the sun it's slowly melting away that's your options time value diminishing as you approach the expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up

option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration

both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stocks for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",TradingView,0.8,0.3

if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's break it down with a real example using ABC stock suppose you're bullish about ABC and it's trading at $8.13 bu a call option with a strike price of $7.50 expiring soon at $90 per contract or 90 cents per contract if ABC hits $9 next month exercising your option allows you to buy it at$ 750 and sell it at $9 netting a tidy profit if not the most you lose is the premium this scenario highlights how strategic foresight coupled with a clear understanding of options can lead to significant financial [Music] advantages put options are like your financial Shield they give you the right not the obligation to sell a certain amount of an asset at a preset price before the option expires this is particularly handy for protecting your stock Investments against dropping prices imagine you own a stock that's at risk of falling in value a put option serves as your safety net letting you sell your shares at a guaranteed price no matter how far the stock dropped these options aren't just for protection they're also a playground for speculators buying a put means you could profit from the decline in an asset's price without ever owning it it's a lowcost strategy for potentially High returns providing a safety layer and a speculative opportunity all rolled up into one put options can act as your Market parachute offering a predetermined sell price which is the strike price which you can use no matter how much the market value of the asset Falls this feature is invaluable in this feature is invaluable in unstable markets where prices can plummet unexpectedly if you're holding put options you've effectively set a floor on the potential Financial hit you could take furthermore put options open the door for speculative traders who bet on a stock or Market's decline this dual utility makes put options a crucial part of any Savvy Investor's toolkit helping you navigate through bearish Market Waters with confidence the price of put options is shaped by various factors including the market price of the asset the strike price time until expiration and the assets volatility essentially the more the market price of the asset drops below the strike price the more valuable the put option becomes this is because it allows the holder to sell at a higher price than the current market rate volatility is especially crucial higher volatility increases the chances of the option being profitable thus raising its price time Al time also plays an important role the more time until expiration the more valuable the option as there's more chance for favorable price movements trading put options mean strategically anticipating Market movements whether you're hedging against potential losses or speculating for profit it begins with picking the right strike price and exporation the balance between the cost of the option and potential Market movements is key conversely writing put options which is selling them suits those expecting stable or Rising asset prices it's a way to earn from premiums while accepting the risk that you might have to buy the asset at the strike price if the market dips unexpectedly exercising the put option means choosing to sell the asset at the strike price often a move made when the market price is significantly lower this decision should balance the intrinsic value of exercising the option against the premium paid to acquire it sometimes however selling the option before it expires can be more profitable especially if it still holds considerable time value this requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and option value ation and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say you buy a put option for XYZ company at a strike price of $180 with a stock currently at $194 if the stock price drops below 180 your option gains value allowing you to either sell the shares at a profit or sell the option itself for a higher price this strategy C your risk to the premium paid contrasting sharply with the unlimited upside if the stock plummets riding put options is a bullish strategy where you earn the premium but risk having to buy the stock at the strike price if it falls below that level it's a way to generate income or potentially buy stock at a net lower price if the option is exercised this requires a precise understanding of market conditions and option valuation choosing between in the- money which is itm and out of the money otm put options depends on your investment strategy in the money options cost more but offer immediate intrinsic value suitable for those looking to hedge out of the money options are cheaper providing higher potential Returns on a significant Market downturn but with greater risk of expiring [Music] worthless imagine you're at an auction but instead of bidding on antiques you're securing a special price for a stock that's your strike price in the realm of options this price is the hard of the deal it's the agreed upon price at which you can buy or sell a stock in the future calls and puts play by these rules either giving you the right to buy or sell at this price let's talk about moneyness a fancy term to describe where the strike price stands in relation to the market price if your strike is lower than the market price for a call option congratulations you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our moneyness mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with a stock yes in the- money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the money option price will leap by7 thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 cents so while the in the money option costs more initially its value aligns more closely with the stocks movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the money option despite its higher price tag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a s Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if your strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor A's safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their daring bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This [Music] Time picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your Hardy main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is short-term akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a season Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a Nuance romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally sell a lot of cash secured puts and covered calls for weekly income which takes advantage of the time Decay and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below and now for some fun The Three Musketeers of options are in the money itm at the money ATM and out of the money motm each with its own character and role in your trading strategy in the money options are your Valiant Athos reliable and strong offering intrinsic value from the get-go because the stock price has already moved beyond the strike price in your favor they're the safer bet sporting a higher price for their inherent value akin to playing for a guaranteed view in a high-rise Hotel you're paying Upfront for the scenery you know you'll get yet their safety comes with a cost a higher premium reflecting their likelihood to end profitably on the other flank we have the daring aramas the otm options with no intrinsic value at the outset but holding a promise of considerable profit should the market swing your way these are the high-risk High reward plays akin to betting on a dark horse in a race their premiums are lower making them accessible but they require a sharp Market upter to breach their strike price and come into profit and then there's poros the at the money option standing bravely at the threshold where the stock price and the strike price meet they repres present a balance of risk and potential their value tied closely to how the market breathes in the short term for Traders they offer a middle ground a blend of potential profitability and risk [Music] management first off what is an option premium think of it like the price tag on your ability to either buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date it's what you pay upfront and it's determined by a mix of factors we're about to explore this concept is the Cornerstone of trading options and understanding it is your first step towards mastering options trading now let's dissect an option premium it consists of intrinsic value that's the actual tangible value if you exercise the option right now and then there's extrinsic value which is a bit more like betting on the Future IT factors in the time left on the option and the stocks volatility together these create the full price of the option blending the real with the what could be so what's driving the option price imagine you're shopping for a car the price changes based on the model features and even the Demand right similarly the price of an option premium is influenced by the Stock's current price how close the option is to making money we call this moneyness the time until the option expires and the Stock's volatility each of these factors either adds to or subtracts from the premium you're willing to pay let's focus on time and volatility for a moment think of time as an ice cube sitting in the sun it's slowly melting away that's your options time value diminishing as you approach the expiration date volatility on the other hand is like predicting the weather high volatility means the stocks price could swing wildly increasing the potential for profit and the options cost next up let's walk you through an example and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's get into it imagine we're looking at the made company called future Tech it's a burgeoning tech firm with rumors of a groundbreaking product on the horizon you've been keeping an eye on this company believing it stock price is set to soar once the product is launched to capitalize on this potential uptick you decide to buy a call option this call option has a premium which is essentially your cost of entry into this speculative Venture the premium you're paying is influenced by your belief in future Tech stock price increase it's a fascinating mix of intrinsic value that is the value if you were to exercise the option immediately and extrinsic value which includes factors like the time until the option expires and how volatile the stock is expected to be now let's break down this premium further the intrinsic value is straightforward if future Tech stock is trading at $100 and your option strike price is $95 the intrinsic value is $5 that's a tangible immediate value if you were to exercise the option right now however the more intriguing part is the extrinsic value this includes the time value which dwindles as the option approaches its expiration making each day a race against the clock then there's the implied volatility reflecting the Market's forecast of future Tech stock price swings if the market expects significant movements due to the rumored product launch the options premium might be higher representing the increased chance of the option ending up in the money this blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values along with your speculation on future Tech success forms the essence of your options premium by purchasing this call option you're not just betting on future Tech success you're doing so with a strategy that limits your risk to the premium paid while offering unlimited upside potential it's a calculated gamble where your insights into future tech industry and potential can turn a modest premium into a significant return however it's also crucial to remember that if future Tech doesn't perform as expected the premium you've paid is the maximum risk you face this example encapsulates the Allure and caution of options trading high potential with controlled risk making it a compelling tool for those who know how to navigate its complexities this detailed exploration into an option premium through the lens of future Tech aims to demystify the process showing how calculated risk can be taken within the options Market it highlights the importance of understanding both the intrinsic and extrinsic values that compose an options premium providing a solid foundation for any investor looking to delve into the dynamic world of options trading [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for

price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those preum premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about 7 C this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price change it to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stakes gamble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our Tech forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs [Music] first things first let's break down what options are Imagine options as your financial Swiss army knife versatile tools that give you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a specific price known as the strike price before a certain date there are two types of options call options for buying and put options for selling but remember with great power comes great responsibility or in our case a premium which is the price you pay for this right now on to the star of the show out ofth money or otm options these are The Underdogs of the options world for a call option to be out of the money the market price of the stock must be lower than the strike price for a put option it's the opposite these options don't have intrinsic value but that doesn't mean they're worthless they're like lottery tickets that haven't won yet but could hit the jackpot before their expiration date you might be wondering why bother with out-of-the money options if they sound like a long shot here's the deal they're cheaper than their in the money counterparts making them an attractive choice for Traders betting on a Stock's future price movement without outbreaking the bank plus the thrill of turning a small investment into a significant profit is too enticing to ignore but remember it's crucial to manage your risks wisely and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine where eyeing Tech Innovations a fictional Powerhouse currently priced at $50 per share you might think why not go for an outof the- money call option with a strike price of $55 sure it's a gamble but what happens when Tech Innovations unveil something revolutionary if that stock skyrockets to $70 your previously out ofth money option doesn't just inch into the money it leaps in offering potential profits that could make your head spin this is where the thrill truly lies in options trading however it's not merely about the excitement this strategy underscores a critical aspect of trading timing is absolutely crucial options have an expiration date and your ability to predict Market movements within this time frame can be the difference between a noteworthy gain and a total loss now let's take this a step further suppose Tech Innovations does launch that groundbreaking product and the market responds with fervor propelling the stock beyond our wildest dreams initially your out-of the money call option seemed like a long shot but as the market dynamics shift what was once deemed risky is now on the verge of paying off it's akin to watching a dark horse race ahead defying odds and expectations however this race against the clock isn't just just about luck it's about informed decisions understanding market trends and sometimes a bit of patience as the expiration date draws near the value of our option hinges not just on Tech Innovations performance but also on the broader Market movements and sentiment will our option cross the finish line in a blaze of glory or will it falter at the last hurdle this chapter isn't just a lesson in options trading it's a testament to the Strategic depth that options offer with tech Innovations our fictional example we see how an out-of- the- money call option can transform from an underdog to a champion given the right market conditions but remember the key to mastering this trade lies not just in choosing the right stock or the right option but in the timing and understanding that in the world of options trading fortunes can change as swiftly as the wind so as you embark on your trading Journey Keep A Keen Eye on the market stay informed and always be prepared to make your move before the clock runs out now despite the Allure of turning a small investment into a considerable return I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of out-of-the money options the initial low cost of these options can be deceiving making them seem like an attractive bargain for those looking to dip their toes into the options trading pool however it's crucial to understand that these Bargains come with their own baggage a high-risk gamble the Stark reality is that unless the stock under goes a dramatic price movement the chances of an out-of-the money option leading to profit are really Slim most of the time these options expire worthless leaving the investor with a 100% loss of their premium this inherent risk paints out of the money options not as the golden tickets they're often mistaken for but as speculative bets that require both a precise Market prediction and perfect timing while the potential for a high payoff is undeniable the path is fraught with a likelihood of loss underscoring the importance of approaching out of the money options with caution and a well thought out strategy what happens when the expiration date approaches and your call option is out of the money it's like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight the magic disappears and the option expires worthless this is the risk you play with otm options however the journey doesn't end here every trade is a lesson learned and with each option you're gaining invaluable experience for your next big [Music] win first up let's talk about what IV actually is imagine you're a weather ,"As a financial analyst, here's a concise summary of the key insights regarding options trading based on the provided video transcript segments:

The transcript introduces options trading as a method to amplify financial prowess, offering leverage and defined risk. Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined **strike price** within a **set time frame** for a **premium**.

**Key Concepts and Types:**
*   **Call Options:** Grant the right to *buy*, profiting from price increases. Risk is limited to the premium, while upside is potentially unlimited. Strategies include long calls (bullish) and short calls (income/protection).
*   **Put Options:** Grant the right to *sell*, acting as a financial shield against price drops or for speculating on declines. Their price is influenced by the underlying asset's market price, strike, time, and volatility. Selling put options is a bullish strategy earning premiums but accepting the obligation to buy the stock if it falls.

**Critical Factors in Option Pricing & Strategy:**
*   **Moneyness:** Describes an option's relationship to the underlying asset's price:
    *   **In-the-Money (ITM):** Options with intrinsic value (calls: strike < market; puts: strike > market).
    *   **Out-of-the-Money (OTM):** Options with no intrinsic value, lower premiums, but higher risk/reward potential (calls: strike > market; puts: strike < market).
    *   **At-the-Money (ATM):** Strike price ≈ market price.
*   **Delta:** Measures how much an option's price changes for every $1 move in the underlying stock. ITM options have higher Delta, moving more in sync with the stock.
*   **Expiration Dates & Time Value (Theta Decay):** Options have a finite life, and their time value (extrinsic value) decays as expiration nears. Timing is crucial, with various timeframes suiting different strategies.
*   **Option Premium:** The total cost, comprising intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time value and implied volatility). Risk is limited to the premium paid.
*   **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's forecast of a stock's potential price swing. High IV suggests significant price changes and leads to higher option premiums. Understanding IV (and monitoring the VIX) is vital for informed decisions; generally, one might buy options when IV is low and sell when IV is high.

**Speaker's Investment Opinions & Recommendations:**
*   **Preference for ITM Call Options:** The speaker strongly recommends buying ITM call options, particularly those with a **Delta around 0.7**, due to their balance of responsiveness, lower risk, and higher probability of success compared to OTM options.
*   **Strong Disfavor for OTM Options:** The speaker views OTM options as a ""high-risk gamble"" or ""lottery tickets."" Despite their low cost, most OTM options expire worthless, resulting in a 100% premium loss. Profiting from them requires exceptionally precise market prediction and perfect timing.
*   **Income Strategies:** The speaker personally utilizes strategies like selling **cash-secured puts and covered calls** for weekly income, leveraging the advantageous decay of time value.",Tech Forward,0.2,0.6

This strategy involves simultaneously trading a call and a put option on the same asset with the same expiration date but different strike prices.

He details two main types:

1.  **Long Strangle:** This involves buying out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options. It is recommended for investors anticipating substantial price swings due to major news or market events, offering unlimited profit potential if the asset moves significantly beyond the strike prices.
2.  **Short Strangle:** This involves selling OTM call and put options. It is suited for a more conservative approach where the market is expected to remain within a specific range, with profit derived from collected premiums if the asset stays within its comfort zone.

Romine illustrates the calculation of break-even points for both upside and downside scenarios using a fictional example. He emphasizes that mastering the strangle strategy allows investors to confidently navigate markets by strategically capitalizing on either high volatility or range-bound conditions.

The speaker personally prefers credit spreads due to this upfront payment and broader profitability range.

**Credit Spreads** involve selling a higher premium option and buying a lower premium one, resulting in a net credit. They are best suited for **volatile markets** as they allow traders to collect upfront premiums and benefit from time decay, remaining profitable even if the market stays flat, moves favorably, or slightly unfavorably. The speaker personally prefers credit spreads due to this upfront payment and broader profitability range.

**Debit Spreads**, conversely, involve buying a higher cost option and selling a lower cost one, leading to an upfront debit. These are recommended for when **moderate directional market moves** are expected, allowing traders to capitalize on specific directional bets with limited risk.

The video emphasizes that options trading requires ""strategy, precision, and a bit of daring."" It strongly advises practicing both strategies in a **paper trading account** to understand their performance across various market conditions, underscoring that ""knowledge is your most valuable asset"" in continuous learning.",Alphatech,0.3,0.8

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey folks Jerry Roman here diving into the world of stock options without the fluff today we're cracking the Cod on covered calls and when to use them a strategy every beginner should know this video will leave you revved up for our next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $11 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you write a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance stay tuned in our next video we're exploring married puts the protective armor for your stocks it's like having a safety net while you reach for the stars until then keep it real and I'll see see you in the next video,"Jerry Roman introduces covered calls as a beginner-friendly options strategy for stock owners to generate premium income by selling call options on shares they already own.

This strategy is recommended for conservative investors or ""cautious optimists"" who anticipate their stock will remain relatively stable or experience modest price increases without exceeding a predetermined strike price. It's presented as a ""savvy move"" to earn extra income (""renting out your stocks"") in low-volatility market environments, suitable when expecting ""mild waves rather than a tsunami"" in stock movement.

However, covered calls should be avoided if you expect the stock to ""skyrocket,"" as profits are capped at the strike price, limiting upside potential. The overarching philosophy emphasizes investing wisely, aligning strategies with expectations and risk tolerance, and exploring alternative income generation methods beyond simply buying low and selling high, rather than engaging in speculative gambling.",Patreon,0.2,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey folks Jerry Roman here diving into the world of stock options without the fluff today we're cracking the Cod on covered calls and when to use them a strategy every beginner should know this video will leave you revved up for our next lesson on married puts fasten your seat belts we're about to make options easy and fun welcome to the world where making money doesn't always mean buying low and selling High today's Spotlight the covered call Imagine owning shares and earning extra by selling someone the option to buy your shares at a set price it's like renting out your stocks while you wait for their value to rise simple right let's break it down further a covered call happens when you own shares that's what your is and sell call options on the same stock think of it as a strategy for the cautious Optimist you're happy to keep your stock but wouldn't mind making some cash on the side while you wait for a slight price bump it's the Investor's way of saying I'm optimistic but let's be real about how high this stock will go let's talk numbers without making your head spin you own a stock at $10 you sell a call option for a $1 premium with a $20 strike price best case scenario you pocket that $1 premium and your stock climbs up to $20 that's an extra $11 per share worst case your stock Dives but hey you've got that $1 premium as a small consolation so when's the time for a perfect covered call when you believe your stock will chill at its current price or go up in value but not past the covered call strike price you sell it's like betting your stock won't be the life of the party but won't sit in the corner either however if you're expecting your stock to Skyrocket then covered calls might not be a good fit for that stock because your profits are capped at the strike price if executed and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example imagine our fictional stock Jerry's gyms trading at a comfortable $25 you're holding tight expecting mild waves rather than a tsunami you write a covered call with a $27 strike price pocketing a neat 75 cent premium per share if Jerry's gym stays under $27 you're the champ keeping your premium and shares but if it skyrockets your profit stops at $27 still not a bad day's work so our covered calls the golden ticket they can be a Savvy move for the conservative investor looking for a bit of extra cash without too much drama remember the goal isn't to gamble but to invest wisely using strategies that align with your expectations and risk tolerance stay tuned in our next video we're exploring married puts the protective armor for your stocks it's like having a safety net while you reach for the stars until then keep it real and I'll see see you in the next video,"Jerry Roman introduces covered calls as a beginner-friendly options strategy for stock owners to generate premium income by selling call options on shares they already own.

This strategy is recommended for conservative investors or ""cautious optimists"" who anticipate their stock will remain relatively stable or experience modest price increases without exceeding a predetermined strike price. It's presented as a ""savvy move"" to earn extra income (""renting out your stocks"") in low-volatility market environments, suitable when expecting ""mild waves rather than a tsunami"" in stock movement.

However, covered calls should be avoided if you expect the stock to ""skyrocket,"" as profits are capped at the strike price, limiting upside potential. The overarching philosophy emphasizes investing wisely, aligning strategies with expectations and risk tolerance, and exploring alternative income generation methods beyond simply buying low and selling high, rather than engaging in speculative gambling.",TradingView,0.2,0.0

High IV signifies an expectation of significant price changes, leading to higher option premiums, while low IV suggests a stable outlook. The VIX, serving as the ""pulse of IV"" for the S&P 500, gauges overall market sentiment. Traders are advised to look up IV on sites like cboe.com rather than calculating it.

Understanding IV is crucial for identifying options market opportunities and risks: high IV periods may be opportune for selling options for a premium, whereas low IV periods might be a good time to buy. However, IV reflects market sentiment, not a definitive prediction, and should be used as one tool within a broader trading strategy.

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en hey everyone it's Jerry here and today we're diving into the exciting world of stock options specifically the concept of in the money options whether you're new to investing or looking to broaden your knowledge this video is your stepping stone to understanding options without getting overwhelmed [Music] let's kick things off with what in the money option means imagine you've got a golden ticket that's an in the money option it's your opportunity to buy or sell a stock at a price that's already profitable for call options this means you can buy the stock for less than its current market price for put options you're able to sell for more than the market rate options aren't just about stocks they can be for bonds Commodities you name it but they're popular with stock for a good reason they offer you the chance but not the obligation to buy or sell at a set price known as the strike price by a certain date every option comes with a price called a premium this isn't a random number it's influenced by the market price of the stock how much time is left until the option expires and how the strike price compares to the Stock's current market price now let's talk turkey with call options you're bullish expecting the stock to rise if the market price Soares above your strike price you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option the difference between the market price and your strike price that's your intrinsic value and it's what makes an option truly valuable on the flip side put options are your best friend when you expect the stock to fall if the strike price is above the market price your option is in the money you want the stock to drop enough to cover your premium and then some leading to a profit everything has its ups and downs itm or in the- money options might be more expensive due to their built-in profit potential but they also come with the chance to make a tidy sum if the market moves in your favor however don't forget about those premiums and fees they can eat into your profits and for those diving deeper into investing I give realtime trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's dissect a more nuanced scenario with our hypothetical stock Tech forward imagine you're eyeing a call option for Tech forward with a strike price of $100 while the current market price is $105 this option is clearly in the money meaning if you exercise your option you can buy shares at $100 a bargain compared to the market price but why stop at understanding just the basics as an investor I often lean towards buying call options with around a 7 Delta and here's the scoop on why I like a 7 Delta it indicates that for every $1 move in the Stock's price the option price is expected to move by about7 this sweet spot means the option is responsive enough to price changes to be profitable yet not so volatile that it's like a high stake scam gble it strikes a balance offering the potential for significant profit while mitigating some risks associated with options trading why does this matter to you the investor when you choose an itm option with a 7 Delta you're essentially opting for an investment that's expected to move closely with the stock but with the added leverage options provide this leverage allows for greater profit potential compared to owning the stock outright however the strategy is not without its nuances the cost of the option or the premium plays a crucial role returning to our forward example if the premium is high it could offset your potential profits thus while the Allure of in the- money options with a 7 Delta is strong due to their favorable balance of risk and responsiveness the key to unlocking their potential lies in meticulous analysis and timing it's not just about picking any in the money option it's about finding those with the right Delta that aligns with your Market Outlook and risk tolerance ensuring your position for profitability even after accounting for premiums and other trading costs and there you have it folks you're now familiar within the money options next up we'll explore out of the money options so stay tuned for more insights that'll help you navigate the stock market like a pro keep it real and I'll see you on the next video,"The speaker introduces ""In the Money"" (ITM) options, defining ITM call options as the ability to buy stock below market price and ITM put options as the ability to sell above it, noting their inherent profit potential. Option premiums are influenced by stock price, time to expiration, and the strike price's relation to market price, making ITM options generally more expensive, which can impact profitability.

The core investment strategy recommended is to **buy ITM call options with approximately a 7 Delta**. This Delta signifies the option price is expected to move by $0.70 for every $1 change in the stock price, positioning it as a ""sweet spot"" for its balance of responsiveness, profitability, and mitigated volatility, offering significant leverage over direct stock ownership. However, the speaker strongly cautions that high premiums necessitate meticulous analysis and precise timing to ensure the strategy's profitability.",TradingView,1.0,0.0

Key factors dictating premium prices include the stock's current price, its ""moneyness"" relative to the strike price, the diminishing time until expiration (time decay), and the stock's overall volatility.

The video implicitly positions options trading as a ""rewarding"" yet ""complex"" endeavor, stressing that understanding these premium components and their influencing factors is the ""cornerstone"" for mastery. Through a hypothetical call option example, it demonstrates how options offer ""limited risk"" (maximum loss capped at the premium paid) combined with ""unlimited upside potential,"" framing them as a ""calculated gamble"" and a ""compelling tool"" for achieving high potential returns with controlled risk.

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en Jerry Romine here and today we're demystifying the world of options like you've never seen before think of it as your favorite movie trailer but instead of the next Blockbuster hit you're unlocking the secrets to financial empowerment let's dive into the realm of options without losing your wits shall we [Music] picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your hearty main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is shortterm akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a seasoned Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a nuanced romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en Jerry Romine here and today we're demystifying the world of options like you've never seen before think of it as your favorite movie trailer but instead of the next Blockbuster hit you're unlocking the secrets to financial empowerment let's dive into the realm of options without losing your wits shall we [Music] picture this you've got a golden ticket but it's not for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory it's for something even sweeter the chance to make or break in the stock market with options but here's the catch that ticket has an expiration date just like milk past its prime an expired option won't do you any good so what's the big deal about these dates stick around and I'll tell you why timing and options trading is everything now imagine walking into the grandest buffet you've ever seen but instead of dishes you've got expiration dates on those options monthly options that's your hearty main course weeklys the spicy appetizer you can't get enough of dailies the shot of espresso to Kickstart your trading day and leaps the fine wine you Savor for years each has its place at the table depending on your appetite for risk and reward diving into the strategy of selecting expiration dates is akin to mastering the art of timing and comedy it's everything when you're you're strategizing about options you're not just picking dates out of a hat you're aligning your financial goals with Market rhythms think of each option like a ticking time piece each tick moving you closer to your moment of truth if your strategy is shortterm akin to sprinting through a thrilling 100 meter dash then weekly or even daily expirations might be your best bet allowing you to capitalize on quick Market moves however for those with a marathoners endurance aiming for long-term growth or hedging positions leaning towards monthly or leaps provides the breathing room needed for your assets to mature like a fine bourbon revealing their true value over time yet the Strategic depth doesn't end at mere time frames it intertwines with understanding Market volatility event-driven strategies and your personal risk tolerance it's about reading the Market's e and flow much like a seasoned Captain navigates the Open Seas using the stars of economic indicators and corporate earnings reports to steer clear of storms picking the right expiration date involves peering through your financial telescope predicting how events like product launches or policy changes might sway stock this anticipation combined with a keen awareness of one's Financial Horizon and stomach for risks crafts a strategy that's not just smart but personalized like tailoring a suit it's about custom fitting your options portfolio to your life not the other way around the tale of expiration dates and option pricing is one for the ages a nuanced romance that unfolds over the life cycle of an option at the heart of the story is time value the premium you pay for what could happen before the option expires in the bloom of Youth when the option is far from its expiration this time value is plump and juicy brimming with potential it's the hope that the stock will soar or plummet depending on whether you're holding calls or puts and the longer the time frame the more you pay for this hope but as the stock clock ticks down this time value begins to wither dwindling to a whisper as expiration looms this inevitable Decay known as Theta is a reminder that in options trading time is a commodity as valuable as the stocks themselves however there's Beauty in this Decay a strategy to be leveraged for sellers of options this time Decay is the slow burning candle that lights the path to profit as the options they sell shrink in extrinsic value with each passing day for buyers the challenge is to find the moment when the potential for an options increase in intrinsic value that's the real movement in the stock price relative to the strike price outpaces the loss of Time Value this delicate balance bance between timing market movement and Decay is the essence of the options dance mastering it requires not just an understanding of the mechanics of options but a feel for the Market's Rhythm the ability to anticipate the beat before it happens and the wisdom to act before the final note is played I personally

you're in the money or itm this means you can buy the stock for less than it's selling for a real bargain for puts it's the reverse out of the money or otm means the market hasn't moved in your favor but hey there's always a chance now let's spice things up by adding Delta into our money mix think of Delta as the heartbeat of an options price movement it tells us how much the price of an option will dance or change with a $1 move in the stock for in the money itm options the heartbeat is strong they have a higher Delta meaning they move more in sync with the stock yes in the money options May cost you more upfront compared to out of the money options but here's the kicker you get more bang for your buck because their value zooms faster than an otm option as the stock price moves imagine you're eyeing options for future Tech which is trading at $100 you have two choices an in the money call option with a strike price of $90 boasting a delta of7 or an out-of-the money call option with a strike price of 110 with a Delta of3 if future Tech stock jumps to 101 here's what happens the in the- money option price will leap by 70 cents thanks to its Delta the out of the money option more like a cautious hop will only increase by 30 C so while the in the money option costs more initially it's value aligns more closely with the Stock's movements offering a speedier ride on your investment dollar this Delta driven Dynamic is crucial for understanding why an in the- money option despite its higher price stag can be a more potent choice for investors looking to closely mirror the Stock's performance it's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward speed and cost so there you have it that's the essence of moneyness and the power of delta in the world of options whether you choose the fast-paced thrill of in the money options or the hopeful watch from the sidelines without out of the money options understanding these Concepts is your first step towards Savvy investing remember these pointers number one the strike price is your golden ticket to buy or sell a stock at a specific price number two in the money and out of the money are not just investor lingo they're your indicators of potential profit number three at the money means the strike price and the market price are playing a tight game of tag number four the higher the Delta the faster the option price will move when buying options I normally like about a 7 Delta and in case you're wondering when Nancy Pelosi buys options they're typically about one year out and they're a very high Delta as well and for those diving deeper into investing I give real-time trade alerts in my patreon and if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's go over an example let's say Tech innovators is trading at $100 if you have a call option with a strike price of $90 you're sitting pretty with an in the- money option but if you're strike price was $110 you're hoping for a rally since you're currently out of the money options are a bit like a seesaw the closer your strike price is to the market price the more valuable your option might be time and volatility are the playground bullies here constantly shaking things up let's cover an example where we explore the outcomes of two very strategic choices in the options Market meet our contenders investor a who prefers playing it somewhat safe and investor B who likes to walk on the wild side investor a safe bet investor a picks a call option for Gadget World currently trading at $95 with a strike price of $100 betting the stock will rise the option has a Delta of 0.5 meaning for every $1 increase in the stock the option price goes up by0 50 investor B's bold move on the flip side investor B goes bold choosing a call option with a strike price of $120 this option has a lower Delta of 02 making its Price Less sensitive to stock price movements but offering higher returns if the stock makes a significant jump as the dust settles Gadget World stock Soares to $115 thanks to a groundbreaking product launch investor A's option is now in the money gaining significant value and providing a comfortable profit from their investment however investor B's option despite the Stock's impressive gain remains out of the money with a stock not reaching the ambitious $120 strike price before expiration investor B's option expires worthless marking a loss on their Daren bet let's go over the lessons learned this example teaches us the delicate balance between risk and potential reward in the options Market investor A's cautious approach paid off with a solid win while investor B's high-risk gamble didn't cross the finish line This Time Each strategy carries its own set of risks and opportunities emphasizing the importance of aligning your options trading with your risk tolerance and Market Outlook and that my friends is the essence of option strike prices remember options trading is a journey filled with learning and excit exitement today's lesson is just the beginning stay tuned for our next adventure where we'll explore option exploration dates together we'll ensure you're well on your way to becoming a Savvy investor keep it real and I'll see you in the next video,"This video segment provides key insights into options trading, focusing on strike prices, moneyness (In-the-Money, Out-of-the-Money, At-the-Money), and Delta.

**Key Investment Opinions:**

*   **Preference for In-the-Money (ITM) Options with High Delta:** The core recommendation is to favor ITM options, specifically those with a Delta of approximately 0.7. This strategy is advocated because high Delta ITM options offer ""more bang for your buck"" and a ""speedier ride,"" as they more closely mirror the underlying stock's performance (e.g., a 0.7 Delta option gains 70 cents for a $1 stock move). While pricier upfront, they are considered a ""more potent choice.""
*   **Align Strategy with Risk Tolerance:** The analysis stresses the critical importance of aligning options trading with individual risk tolerance and market outlook. It contrasts the lower risk, higher probability of profit with ITM options against the higher risk, potential for total loss with Out-of-the-Money (OTM) options, which can expire worthless if the stock doesn't reach the ambitious strike.

**Key Concepts & Market Commentary:**

*   **Strike Price:** The agreed price for future stock transaction.
*   **Moneyness:** Categorizes the option's relation to the current stock price (ITM for profit potential, OTM for speculative bets, ATM when close).
*   **Delta:** The sensitivity of an option's price to a $1 move in the underlying stock.
*   **Nancy Pelosi's Strategy:** Noted as an anecdotal example, her reported options purchases are typically long-dated (one year out) and possess a very high Delta.
*   **Market Dynamics:** Time and volatility are highlighted as significant factors (""playground bullies"") influencing the options market.",Gadget World,0.95,0.8

vehicles the magic Behind These Innovations is not just in the software but also in the tiny yet powerful semiconductor chips today I'm going to challenge what you might think about investing in these Technologies and show you why certain companies are not just participating in the AI Revolution they're leading it your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one the EXP floating demand for AI accelerator chips and its impact on the semiconductor industry number two why semiconductor stocks especially certain standout companies are poised for significant growth number three a detailed fundamental analysis of top semiconductor firms to help you make informed investment decisions and number four exclusive insights and tips for long-term investment strategies in the volatile Tech sector [Music] the AI accelerator chip Market surged to $5 billion in 2023 and is projected to hit 20 billion in 2024 this unprecedented growth is driven by the expanding role of AI across multiple sectors like healthcare automotive and consumer electronics despite facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled workers the industry's trajectory points toward sustained expansion companies like AMD Qualcomm Micron Nvidia broadcom and Intel are not just beneficiaries of the AI boom they are its Architects each of these Giants is pushing the boundaries of chip technology with nvidia's a100 tinser core GPU and amd's third generation epyc processors leading the charge in innovation tailored for AI applications as the demand for Semiconductor chips balloons the stocks of semiconductor companies have become worth trillions and is set to go much higher next up let's do a side-by-side fundamental analysis of these stocks and what you see is going to blow you away because some of these stocks shine and others I wouldn't touch with a 10-ft pole and for those wanting to dive deeper into investing I provide real-time trade alerts in my patreon if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's jump into the beast mode side by-side analysis we're now at beast mode analysis.com for our sidebyside we're going to be looking at Advanced Micro Devices ticker AMD qualcom qcom Micron Technology mu Nvidia nvda broadcom avgo and Intel INTC the first thing we want to look at is going to be the PE Ratio we can see AMD is coming in at 309 Qualcomm 24.4 mu negative and that's because their net income margin is negative right now we've got Nvidia coming in at 72.1 then we've got avgo 52.9 and Intel at 91.6 now surprisingly these numbers are a little bit higher than expected at least for me and our lowest on the day is actually going to be Qualcomm at 24.4 next up let's come down and look at the income statement and this tells us whether or not the companies are making money and I really believe a fundamental analysis can be easy when you present the data in the right way so we got a couple of things working for us light blue this is my favorite part of each section light green is my second favorite then we also have cheat sheet so if we look at the operating margin we can see this up arrow and we like this to be more than 10% for long-term stocks we can see AMD operating on a pretty slim margin at 1.76 their net income margin is also pretty low at 3.76 Qualcomm they're better 21.74% we've got mu they're coming in negative flag for me we've got Nvidia they're very strong their operating margin 54% their net income margin crazy high at 48.8 4% next up we've got broadcom very good operating margin 45.92 net income margin very strong at 39.3 1% and Intel 3.11% for a net income margin their operating margin super slim so just by looking at the income statement we can see there's a big difference between these companies we've got three of them with decent recent profits Qualcomm Nvidia and avgo and the rest are already lagging far behind next up let's come down and look at the compounded annual growth rate and if you need to know what anything means on the beast mode all you do is hover over the eye and here we've got the definition of the compound annual growth rate and then we've got a little cheat sheet down here that says if you're an investor looking for stable returns by investing in strong and large companies from the financial market then 8 to 12% is a good cagr percentage for you so let's go ahead and take a look at these and we can see we've got AMD coming in at 15.6 we've got cuom low mu low Nvidia our highest on the day 30.9 avgo 30.4 so we got a lot of information here and the Beast Mode walks you through the fundamental analysis where you can look up anything you like the balance sheet tells us whether or not companies are financially stable and I like to look at what I call the tattle ratio and this is kind of a cheat sheet on the stock it's kind of like what the net worth of the stock is D if they got a lot more assets than they do like liabilities so if we look at AMD these guys are coming in the best and we can see their total assets are 67.8 billion their total liabilities are 11.9 billion and that gives them a tattle ratio of 5.66 very strong and typically speaking I like this to come in above two we've got Qualcomm strong as well 1.73 mu looking really good 3.19 Invidia looking good 2.89 avgo 1.49 and Intel 2.35 so overall most of these guys are looking pretty good all right the key performance metrics these are all very insightful to the company's overall condition and you'll notice everything here is blue that's because I think they're all important so for Revenue growth last year all of these companies except two actually had a negative Revenue growth all these ones in red here red flag not a good thing unless there's extenda circumstances that explain them but we can see Nvidia Head and Shoulders Above the Rest 125.81614610 so if you guys think about it Nvidia they shot up a crazy amount in the last year and look at this they're the ones who had the biggest Revenue growth last year so it makes perfect sense avgo they grew last year as well 7.87 the rest were Contracting free cash flow margin another very important item this tells us how much free cash they've got coming in lets the companies pay the bills and expand the business so we can see mu's got some cash problems right here our winner on the day avgo 49.2 % coming in at number two Nvidia 44.3 5 Qualcomm strong as well at 27.8 5 and then the rest are lagging then we've got the ru of 40 indicator I love this uh Nvidia is our winner here at 170% number two avgo 57.0 n we've got my fnr indicator and this is just simply a down and dirty indicator that sums up the free cash flow the net income margin and the revenue growth sums all of them together and the bigger that number the better and check it out our winner Nvidia 219 avgo 96.4 so you can see two stocks are really starting to stand out in all of the different categories and then the book value anytime we've got a number over one I love looking at that we don't have that here but our strongest on the day is Intel at 75 management Effectiveness tells us how well management is generating returns for investors and I like to look at the return on equity and the 5r indicator and we can see we've almost got a clean sweep here cuz blue is best in cat atory Nvidia absolutely owning it and then on the 5r this sums up all of the different returns for investors gives us a number the bigger the better our number one Nvidia 368.81 19.7 our number three Qualcomm and then we've got growth metrics companies should be consistently growing their business our net income growth Nvidia the winner here again 5813 and this is why Nvidia has shot up in value so much a lot of people are thinking hey man Nvidia is overvalued but when you look at the fundamentals you can see there's a strong case to be made for why Nvidia has shot up then we also have the aid growth another one that I like to look at Compares everybody and check this out only two have a positive number Nvidia 384.94 and Nvidia again heads and shoulders above the competition and then the last thing that I want to look at real quickly is the revenue growth forecast for the next year we can see AMD 13 .3% Qualcomm 6.1% Micron Technology 58% Nvidia 78.5% broadcom 40.2% and Intel's Revenue growth forecast 6.1% so when you look at all of these numbers this is a clear-cut case where two stocks are definitely jumping out compared to the rest and it's not even close after our analysis it's clear that Nvidia and broadcom are setting the pace in the semiconductor sector with nvidia's robust net income margin and extraordinary Revenue growth alongside broadcom's impressive financials and more reasonable valuation these two were my top picks for anyone bullish on the future of AI and ready to handle the inherent risks of tech investing keep it real and I'll see you on the next video,"The AI accelerator chip market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to quadruple from $5 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in 2024, creating significant opportunities for semiconductor stocks. A detailed fundamental analysis of six major players identifies **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **Broadcom (AVGO)** as the top investment picks for those bullish on the future of AI.

Nvidia is highly recommended for its exceptional financial performance, including a robust 48.84% net income margin, extraordinary 125.8% revenue growth (last year), and high free cash flow, which are seen as justifying its premium valuation. Broadcom is also a top pick, recognized for its impressive financials (e.g., 39.31% net income margin, 49.20% free cash flow margin) and strong growth at a more reasonable valuation compared to Nvidia. In contrast, companies like Micron, AMD, and Intel are noted for lagging in profitability and growth metrics, with Nvidia and Broadcom highlighted as clear standouts setting the pace in the sector.",AMD,1.0,-0.4

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation",Kind: captions Language: en have you ever wondered what powers the AI Revolution that's reshaping our world from voice activated assistance to autonomous vehicles the magic Behind These Innovations is not just in the software but also in the tiny yet powerful semiconductor chips today I'm going to challenge what you might think about investing in these Technologies and show you why certain companies are not just participating in the AI Revolution they're leading it your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one the EXP floating demand for AI accelerator chips and its impact on the semiconductor industry number two why semiconductor stocks especially certain standout companies are poised for significant growth number three a detailed fundamental analysis of top semiconductor firms to help you make informed investment decisions and number four exclusive insights and tips for long-term investment strategies in the volatile Tech sector [Music] the AI accelerator chip Market surged to $5 billion in 2023 and is projected to hit 20 billion in 2024 this unprecedented growth is driven by the expanding role of AI across multiple sectors like healthcare automotive and consumer electronics despite facing challenges such as a shortage of skilled workers the industry's trajectory points toward sustained expansion companies like AMD Qualcomm Micron Nvidia broadcom and Intel are not just beneficiaries of the AI boom they are its Architects each of these Giants is pushing the boundaries of chip technology with nvidia's a100 tinser core GPU and amd's third generation epyc processors leading the charge in innovation tailored for AI applications as the demand for Semiconductor chips balloons the stocks of semiconductor companies have become worth trillions and is set to go much higher next up let's do a side-by-side fundamental analysis of these stocks and what you see is going to blow you away because some of these stocks shine and others I wouldn't touch with a 10-ft pole and for those wanting to dive deeper into investing I provide real-time trade alerts in my patreon if you'd like to try my trading view custom indicators there's a free trial link in the description below with that out of the way let's jump into the beast mode side by-side analysis we're now at beast mode analysis.com for our sidebyside we're going to be looking at Advanced Micro Devices ticker AMD qualcom qcom Micron Technology mu Nvidia nvda broadcom avgo and Intel INTC the first thing we want to look at is going to be the PE Ratio we can see AMD is coming in at 309 Qualcomm 24.4 mu negative and that's because their net income margin is negative right now we've got Nvidia coming in at 72.1 then we've got avgo 52.9 and Intel at 91.6 now surprisingly these numbers are a little bit higher than expected at least for me and our lowest on the day is actually going to be Qualcomm at 24.4 next up let's come down and look at the income statement and this tells us whether or not the companies are making money and I really believe a fundamental analysis can be easy when you present the data in the right way so we got a couple of things working for us light blue this is my favorite part of each section light green is my second favorite then we also have cheat sheet so if we look at the operating margin we can see this up arrow and we like this to be more than 10% for long-term stocks we can see AMD operating on a pretty slim margin at 1.76 their net income margin is also pretty low at 3.76 Qualcomm they're better 21.74% we've got mu they're coming in negative flag for me we've got Nvidia they're very strong their operating margin 54% their net income margin crazy high at 48.8 4% next up we've got broadcom very good operating margin 45.92 net income margin very strong at 39.3 1% and Intel 3.11% for a net income margin their operating margin super slim so just by looking at the income statement we can see there's a big difference between these companies we've got three of them with decent recent profits Qualcomm Nvidia and avgo and the rest are already lagging far behind next up let's come down and look at the compounded annual growth rate and if you need to know what anything means on the beast mode all you do is hover over the eye and here we've got the definition of the compound annual growth rate and then we've got a little cheat sheet down here that says if you're an investor looking for stable returns by investing in strong and large companies from the financial market then 8 to 12% is a good cagr percentage for you so let's go ahead and take a look at these and we can see we've got AMD coming in at 15.6 we've got cuom low mu low Nvidia our highest on the day 30.9 avgo 30.4 so we got a lot of information here and the Beast Mode walks you through the fundamental analysis where you can look up anything you like the balance sheet tells us whether or not companies are financially stable and I like to look at what I call the tattle ratio and this is kind of a cheat sheet on the stock it's kind of like what the net worth of the stock is D if they got a lot more assets than they do like liabilities so if we look at AMD these guys are coming in the best and we can see their total assets are 67.8 billion their total liabilities are 11.9 billion and that gives them a tattle ratio of 5.66 very strong and typically speaking I like this to come in above two we've got Qualcomm strong as well 1.73 mu looking really good 3.19 Invidia looking good 2.89 avgo 1.49 and Intel 2.35 so overall most of these guys are looking pretty good all right the key performance metrics these are all very insightful to the company's overall condition and you'll notice everything here is blue that's because I think they're all important so for Revenue growth last year all of these companies except two actually had a negative Revenue growth all these ones in red here red flag not a good thing unless there's extenda circumstances that explain them but we can see Nvidia Head and Shoulders Above the Rest 125.81614610 so if you guys think about it Nvidia they shot up a crazy amount in the last year and look at this they're the ones who had the biggest Revenue growth last year so it makes perfect sense avgo they grew last year as well 7.87 the rest were Contracting free cash flow margin another very important item this tells us how much free cash they've got coming in lets the companies pay the bills and expand the business so we can see mu's got some cash problems right here our winner on the day avgo 49.2 % coming in at number two Nvidia 44.3 5 Qualcomm strong as well at 27.8 5 and then the rest are lagging then we've got the ru of 40 indicator I love this uh Nvidia is our winner here at 170% number two avgo 57.0 n we've got my fnr indicator and this is just simply a down and dirty indicator that sums up the free cash flow the net income margin and the revenue growth sums all of them together and the bigger that number the better and check it out our winner Nvidia 219 avgo 96.4 so you can see two stocks are really starting to stand out in all of the different categories and then the book value anytime we've got a number over one I love looking at that we don't have that here but our strongest on the day is Intel at 75 management Effectiveness tells us how well management is generating returns for investors and I like to look at the return on equity and the 5r indicator and we can see we've almost got a clean sweep here cuz blue is best in cat atory Nvidia absolutely owning it and then on the 5r this sums up all of the different returns for investors gives us a number the bigger the better our number one Nvidia 368.81 19.7 our number three Qualcomm and then we've got growth metrics companies should be consistently growing their business our net income growth Nvidia the winner here again 5813 and this is why Nvidia has shot up in value so much a lot of people are thinking hey man Nvidia is overvalued but when you look at the fundamentals you can see there's a strong case to be made for why Nvidia has shot up then we also have the aid growth another one that I like to look at Compares everybody and check this out only two have a positive number Nvidia 384.94 and Nvidia again heads and shoulders above the competition and then the last thing that I want to look at real quickly is the revenue growth forecast for the next year we can see AMD 13 .3% Qualcomm 6.1% Micron Technology 58% Nvidia 78.5% broadcom 40.2% and Intel's Revenue growth forecast 6.1% so when you look at all of these numbers this is a clear-cut case where two stocks are definitely jumping out compared to the rest and it's not even close after our analysis it's clear that Nvidia and broadcom are setting the pace in the semiconductor sector with nvidia's robust net income margin and extraordinary Revenue growth alongside broadcom's impressive financials and more reasonable valuation these two were my top picks for anyone bullish on the future of AI and ready to handle the inherent risks of tech investing keep it real and I'll see you on the next video,"The AI accelerator chip market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to quadruple from $5 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in 2024, creating significant opportunities for semiconductor stocks. A detailed fundamental analysis of six major players identifies **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **Broadcom (AVGO)** as the top investment picks for those bullish on the future of AI.

Nvidia is highly recommended for its exceptional financial performance, including a robust 48.84% net income margin, extraordinary 125.8% revenue growth (last year), and high free cash flow, which are seen as justifying its premium valuation. Broadcom is also a top pick, recognized for its impressive financials (e.g., 39.31% net income margin, 49.20% free cash flow margin) and strong growth at a more reasonable valuation compared to Nvidia. In contrast, companies like Micron, AMD, and Intel are noted for lagging in profitability and growth metrics, with Nvidia and Broadcom highlighted as clear standouts setting the pace in the sector.",Nvidia,1.0,0.9

Nvidia 384.94 and Nvidia again heads and shoulders above the competition and then the last thing that I want to look at real quickly is the revenue growth forecast for the next year we can see AMD 13 .3% Qualcomm 6.1% Micron Technology 58% Nvidia 78.5% broadcom 40.2% and Intel's Revenue growth forecast 6.1% so when you look at all of these numbers this is a clear-cut case where two stocks are definitely jumping out compared to the rest and it's not even close after our analysis it's clear that Nvidia and broadcom are setting the pace in the semiconductor sector with nvidia's robust net income margin and extraordinary Revenue growth alongside broadcom's impressive financials and more reasonable valuation these two were my top picks for anyone bullish on the future of AI and ready to handle the inherent risks of tech investing keep it real and I'll see you on the next video,"The AI accelerator chip market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to quadruple from $5 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in 2024, creating significant opportunities for semiconductor stocks. A detailed fundamental analysis of six major players identifies **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **Broadcom (AVGO)** as the top investment picks for those bullish on the future of AI.

Nvidia is highly recommended for its exceptional financial performance, including a robust 48.84% net income margin, extraordinary 125.8% revenue growth (last year), and high free cash flow, which are seen as justifying its premium valuation. Broadcom is also a top pick, recognized for its impressive financials (e.g., 39.31% net income margin, 49.20% free cash flow margin) and strong growth at a more reasonable valuation compared to Nvidia. In contrast, companies like Micron, AMD, and Intel are noted for lagging in profitability and growth metrics, with Nvidia and Broadcom highlighted as clear standouts setting the pace in the sector.",Intel,1.0,-0.7

the significant wealth-building potential of a $50,000 investment in the Invesco QQQ ETF over 30 years, aiming for a comfortable retirement. The presenter strongly recommends QQQ as a long-term investment, asserting that an initial $50,000, or even smaller consistent contributions, could lead to multi-millionaire status.

This recommendation is based on QQQ's strategic focus on the NASDAQ 100, which comprises ""MVP"" non-financial leaders like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon (57% tech sector exposure), driving innovation in areas like AI and cloud computing. Supporting evidence includes the NASDAQ 100's impressive 39-year annualized return of 13.65% (excluding dividends), a 10.75% average annual dividend payout growth over the last five years (despite a low initial yield of 0.54%), and QQQ's efficiency due to good liquidity and a lower expense ratio.

Based on these historical figures, financial projections estimate:
*   A $50,000 initial investment could grow to approximately **$2.53 million** in 30 years (an average annual return of 13.97%).
*   Starting with $10,000 and contributing an additional $300 per month could reach about **$1.78 million** over the same period.

The primary focus of this investment strategy is capital appreciation and the ""snowball effect"" of long-term compounding growth, rather than immediate dividend income.",Invesco,0.9,0.8

the significant wealth-building potential of a $50,000 investment in the Invesco QQQ ETF over 30 years, aiming for a comfortable retirement. The presenter strongly recommends QQQ as a long-term investment, asserting that an initial $50,000, or even smaller consistent contributions, could lead to multi-millionaire status.

This recommendation is based on QQQ's strategic focus on the NASDAQ 100, which comprises ""MVP"" non-financial leaders like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon (57% tech sector exposure), driving innovation in areas like AI and cloud computing. Supporting evidence includes the NASDAQ 100's impressive 39-year annualized return of 13.65% (excluding dividends), a 10.75% average annual dividend payout growth over the last five years (despite a low initial yield of 0.54%), and QQQ's efficiency due to good liquidity and a lower expense ratio.

Based on these historical figures, financial projections estimate:
*   A $50,000 initial investment could grow to approximately **$2.53 million** in 30 years (an average annual return of 13.97%).
*   Starting with $10,000 and contributing an additional $300 per month could reach about **$1.78 million** over the same period.

The primary focus of this investment strategy is capital appreciation and the ""snowball effect"" of long-term compounding growth, rather than immediate dividend income.",Apple,1.0,0.9

the significant wealth-building potential of a $50,000 investment in the Invesco QQQ ETF over 30 years, aiming for a comfortable retirement. The presenter strongly recommends QQQ as a long-term investment, asserting that an initial $50,000, or even smaller consistent contributions, could lead to multi-millionaire status.

This recommendation is based on QQQ's strategic focus on the NASDAQ 100, which comprises ""MVP"" non-financial leaders like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon (57% tech sector exposure), driving innovation in areas like AI and cloud computing. Supporting evidence includes the NASDAQ 100's impressive 39-year annualized return of 13.65% (excluding dividends), a 10.75% average annual dividend payout growth over the last five years (despite a low initial yield of 0.54%), and QQQ's efficiency due to good liquidity and a lower expense ratio.

Based on these historical figures, financial projections estimate:
*   A $50,000 initial investment could grow to approximately **$2.53 million** in 30 years (an average annual return of 13.97%).
*   Starting with $10,000 and contributing an additional $300 per month could reach about **$1.78 million** over the same period.

The primary focus of this investment strategy is capital appreciation and the ""snowball effect"" of long-term compounding growth, rather than immediate dividend income.",Nvidia,1.0,0.9

the significant wealth-building potential of a $50,000 investment in the Invesco QQQ ETF over 30 years, aiming for a comfortable retirement. The presenter strongly recommends QQQ as a long-term investment, asserting that an initial $50,000, or even smaller consistent contributions, could lead to multi-millionaire status.

This recommendation is based on QQQ's strategic focus on the NASDAQ 100, which comprises ""MVP"" non-financial leaders like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon (57% tech sector exposure), driving innovation in areas like AI and cloud computing. Supporting evidence includes the NASDAQ 100's impressive 39-year annualized return of 13.65% (excluding dividends), a 10.75% average annual dividend payout growth over the last five years (despite a low initial yield of 0.54%), and QQQ's efficiency due to good liquidity and a lower expense ratio.

Based on these historical figures, financial projections estimate:
*   A $50,000 initial investment could grow to approximately **$2.53 million** in 30 years (an average annual return of 13.97%).

don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community Tab and stay a step ahead in the investment game keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","This video explores the significant wealth-building potential of a $50,000 investment in the Invesco QQQ ETF over 30 years, aiming for a comfortable retirement. The presenter strongly recommends QQQ as a long-term investment, asserting that an initial $50,000, or even smaller consistent contributions, could lead to multi-millionaire status.

This recommendation is based on QQQ's strategic focus on the NASDAQ 100, which comprises ""MVP"" non-financial leaders like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon (57% tech sector exposure), driving innovation in areas like AI and cloud computing. Supporting evidence includes the NASDAQ 100's impressive 39-year annualized return of 13.65% (excluding dividends), a 10.75% average annual dividend payout growth over the last five years (despite a low initial yield of 0.54%), and QQQ's efficiency due to good liquidity and a lower expense ratio.

Based on these historical figures, financial projections estimate:
*   A $50,000 initial investment could grow to approximately **$2.53 million** in 30 years (an average annual return of 13.97%).
*   Starting with $10,000 and contributing an additional $300 per month could reach about **$1.78 million** over the same period.

The primary focus of this investment strategy is capital appreciation and the ""snowball effect"" of long-term compounding growth, rather than immediate dividend income.",Costco,1.0,0.9

I'll illustrate how $50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job through dividends and growth plus I'll give you a couple of other bonus scenarios and number four I'm going to wrap things up by

dividend Equity ETF and cover what it is what it does and its impressively low expense ratio of just 0 6% think of Schwab as your future retirement that you can use to get peace of mind that gives you a solid foothold in the market with a mix of stability dividends and growth potential this ETF or exchange traded fund is like a carefully curated playlist of stocks across various sectors offering you a piece of the action in everything from Tech to healthcare but here's where it gets interesting what sets SCD apart is its focus on dividend growth meaning it specifically picks stocks that not only pay dividends but have the potential to increase those payouts over time all while keeping your cost low with its minimal expense ratio so investing in SD is like planting a seed that grows not just through the value of the ETF itself but through increasingly larger dividend checks without eating into your returns with high fees it's designed for those who are playing the long game looking for steady income and growth making it a standout option for building your investment or retirement portfolio in essence SCD is more than just an ETF it's a gateway to financial growth offering a balanced approach to earning from the markets ups and downs with the added perk of being incredibly cost-effective while always paying dividends let's break down why I love CHD and I think you'll see why it's not just any ETF on the market picture this SCD is currently trading at around $79 per share and it's near the all-time highs which beckons the question of can it go higher first we're looking at the big picture and having SD as a 30-year investment so in the overall scope today's price doesn't matter over a 30-year time frame and second the FED plans to lower interest rates which makes borrowing money cheaper for everyone including big companies for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that payout part for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that pay out part of their profits as dividends this is great news lower interest rates mean these companies can save money on their loans make more money because people are spending more and ultimately share more profits with their investors through bigger dividends dividend stocks especially those with stable and reliable payouts become more valuable to investors in a lower interest rate environment because investors are willing to pay more for the perceived safety and income generation of these stocks which is likely to lead to a higher stock price for SD but here's where it

dividend yield is 3.41% which may not be that high but it is consistent in something we can likely count on for years to come here you can see SD's dividend growth over the last 10 years has been steadily increasing and you'll see why this is important when we start plugging the numbers into the dividend calculator I'm going to use conservative numbers today now one key figure we need is the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 11 years from 2013 to 2023 it's been 11.16% keep this 11.16% in mind because I'm going to be even more cautious and use 8% in the dividend calculator for the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year I want to make sure these numbers aren't confusing our next key figure is the stock appreciation since Inception SCD has increased by 212% which is about 19% per year however I think that's too high and not realistic to continue moving forward looking at the 5-year average it's 10.37% I'm going to be super conservative and use 6% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage in our calculations the key figures I'm using for both the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreci appreciation percentage in the dividend calculator are much lower than the historical averages I want to make sure you know where these numbers come from so you don't think I'm just making this stuff up I'm being extra conservative on purpose if you like how I'm breaking this down and being careful with the numbers let me know in the comments so I know to include these types of explanations in my future videos looking at the bigger picture with these conservative numbers I'm going to show you why SD is a great choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SD to purchase more shares this method allows you to supercharge growing your investment over the next 30 Years thanks to the power of compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the more it rolls the bigger it gets that's the secret behind Building Wealth with SCD now let me show you how just $50,000 in SD could beat your full-time job and

see the math let's get our dividend calculator set up first thing we want to come down to the distribution frequency and we want to change that to quarterly we want to make sure the drip is on so we're reinvesting our starting principal is going to be $50,000 dividend tax rate will'll leave that at 15% the initial annual dividend yield that's 3.41% are expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year is 8% and we just covered where that number came from the expected annual share price appreciation 6% and remember both of these numbers are conservative our years invested are 30 now let's go ahead and calculate the dividends in our first year we're starting with $50,000 in principal our annual dividend works out to $1,726 193 and if you look at the numbers they're not that impressive and that's completely normal after 5 years we're looking at principal of $7,695 annual dividend $2,631 10 years we're at $110,000 and $451 in dividends after 15 years now it's starting to get a little bit better $174,300 $785 in dividends dropping down to 20 years $280,000 with $3,893 in dividends 25 years $459,000 with over $255,000 in dividends and now you can see the cumulative effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a

don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community tab to stay a step ahead in the investment game [Music] name keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD Might Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a compelling long-term investment strategy to achieve financial independence and potentially replace a full-time job's income.

SCHD is highlighted for its exceptionally low 0.06% expense ratio and its focus on dividend *growth* stocks, selecting companies likely to increase payouts over time. Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",Charles Schwab,1.0,1.0

Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",Texas Instruments,0.95,0.8

you think today we're diving into the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as ticker symbol SCD and showing you how an initial $50,000 investment could potentially outpace your full-time job's income your time's valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one we'll explore Schwab's us dividend Equity ETF and dive into what it is its low expense rtio and its dividend growth Focus number two we'll cover whyd excites me and discuss its performance and consistent dividend yield number three we'll go over a real world example and I'll illustrate how $50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job through dividends and growth plus I'll give you a couple of other bonus scenarios and number four I'm going to wrap things up by shining a spotlight on the incredible benefits of SD as a long-term investment and trust me you'll want to stick around to the very end because the grand finale it's going to be epic something you definitely did not see coming and if you're new here don't forget to hit that subscribe button and ring the bell so you never miss an [Music] update all right let's dive into the famous Schwab us dividend Equity ETF and cover what it is what it does and its impressively low expense ratio of just 0 6% think of Schwab as your future retirement that you can use to get peace of mind that gives you a solid foothold in the market with a mix of stability dividends and growth potential this ETF or exchange traded fund is like a carefully curated playlist of stocks across various sectors offering you a piece of the action in everything from Tech to healthcare but here's where it gets interesting what sets SCD apart is its focus on dividend growth meaning it specifically picks stocks that not only pay dividends but have the potential to increase those payouts over time all while keeping your cost low with its minimal expense ratio so investing in SD is like planting a seed that grows not just through the value of the ETF itself but through increasingly larger dividend checks without eating into your returns with high fees it's designed for those who are playing the long game looking for steady income and growth making it a standout option for building your investment or retirement portfolio in essence SCD is more than just an ETF it's a gateway to financial growth offering a balanced approach to earning from the markets ups and downs with the added perk of being incredibly cost-effective while always paying dividends let's break down why I love CHD and I think you'll see why it's not just any ETF on the market picture this SCD is currently trading at around $79 per share and it's near the all-time highs which beckons the question of can it go higher first we're looking at the big picture and having SD as a 30-year investment so in the overall scope today's price doesn't matter over a 30-year time frame and second the FED plans to lower interest rates which makes borrowing money cheaper for everyone including big companies for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that payout part for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that pay out part of their profits as dividends this is great news lower interest rates mean these companies can save money on their loans make more money because people are spending more and ultimately share more profits with their investors through bigger dividends dividend stocks especially those with stable and reliable payouts become more valuable to investors in a lower interest rate environment because investors are willing to pay more for the perceived safety and income generation of these stocks which is likely to lead to a higher stock price for SD but here's where it gets really exciting for conservative investors that desire a low-risk portfolio the top 10 Holdings ofd are stable stocks that have withstood the test of time Texas Instruments UPS Home Depot Black Rock Cisco Systems Pepsi Lockheed Martin fizer Chevron and Bristol Meyer squib it's a dividend lovers dream portfolio diving deeper SD sector exposure is brilliantly balanced with 17.12% in Industrials 16.73% in financials 15.9% in healthcare 11.95% in consumer staples 9.2 25% in energy and the rest are spread across various sectors this level of diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in just one basket even if a few stocks don't perform as expected the etf's broad coverage Shields you from significant impact now let's talk about dividends the trailing 12-month dividend yield is 3.41% which may not be that high but it is consistent in something we can likely count on for years to come here you can see SD's dividend growth over the last 10 years has been steadily increasing and you'll see why this is important when we start plugging the numbers into the dividend calculator I'm going to use conservative numbers today now one key figure we need is the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 11 years from 2013 to 2023 it's been 11.16% keep this 11.16% in mind because I'm going to be even more cautious and use 8% in the dividend calculator for the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year I want to make sure these numbers aren't confusing our next key figure is the stock appreciation since Inception SCD has increased by 212% which is about 19% per year however I think that's too high and not realistic to continue moving forward looking at the 5-year average it's 10.37% I'm going to be super conservative and use 6% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage in our calculations the key figures I'm using for both the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreci appreciation percentage in the dividend calculator are much lower than the historical averages I want to make sure you know where these numbers come from so you don't think I'm just making this stuff up I'm being extra conservative on purpose if you like how I'm breaking this down and being careful with the numbers let me know in the comments so I know to include these types of explanations in my future videos looking at the bigger picture with these conservative numbers I'm going to show you why SD is a great choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SD to purchase more shares this method allows you to supercharge growing your investment over the next 30 Years thanks to the power of compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the more it rolls the bigger it gets that's the secret behind Building Wealth with SCD now let me show you how just $50,000 in SD could beat your full-time job and retire you rich and if you feel I've earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button show some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has real-time Trading alerts and if you're interested in trying out my custom trading view indicators there's a free trial link below thanks and with that covered let's play with the dividend calculator so you can see the math let's get our dividend calculator set up first thing we want to come down to the distribution frequency and we want to change that to quarterly we want to make sure the drip is on so we're reinvesting our starting principal is going to be $50,000 dividend tax rate will'll leave that at 15% the initial annual dividend yield that's 3.41% are expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year is 8% and we just covered where that number came from the expected annual share price appreciation 6% and remember both of these numbers are conservative our years invested are 30 now let's go ahead and calculate the dividends in our first year we're starting with $50,000 in principal our annual dividend works out to $1,726 193 and if you look at the numbers they're not that impressive and that's completely normal after 5 years we're looking at principal of $7,695 annual dividend $2,631 10 years we're at $110,000 and $451 in dividends after 15 years now it's starting to get a little bit better $174,300 $785 in dividends dropping down to 20 years $280,000 with $3,893 in dividends 25 years $459,000 with over $255,000 in dividends and now you can see the cumulative effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a future where your investment support you is just not true with smart choices like SCD even a single investment of $50,000 or starting small and consistently growing your SD portfolio could grow to replace $50,000 in income over time patience and smart investing can make a huge difference let's recap our conservative numbers the $50,000 investment in CHD turned into $853,000 the total return is 1, 166% the average annual return is 99.92% after 30 years the annual dividend income is over $52,000 if you're curious ious about how the portfolio looks using the 5-year historical averages hang tight I'll share those numbers with you in just a moment today's video goes beyond just investing it's about making wise investment choices with an ETF known for its consistent dividend payouts and

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en are you dreaming of the day your investment can finally set you free from your 9 to-5 grind well that day might be closer than you think today we're diving into the Schwab us dividend Equity ETF better known as ticker symbol SCD and showing you how an initial $50,000 investment could potentially outpace your full-time job's income your time's valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one we'll explore Schwab's us dividend Equity ETF and dive into what it is its low expense rtio and its dividend growth Focus number two we'll cover whyd excites me and discuss its performance and consistent dividend yield number three we'll go over a real world example and I'll illustrate how $50,000 in SD could outperform your full-time job through dividends and growth plus I'll give you a couple of other bonus scenarios and number four I'm going to wrap things up by shining a spotlight on the incredible benefits of SD as a long-term investment and trust me you'll want to stick around to the very end because the grand finale it's going to be epic something you definitely did not see coming and if you're new here don't forget to hit that subscribe button and ring the bell so you never miss an [Music] update all right let's dive into the famous Schwab us dividend Equity ETF and cover what it is what it does and its impressively low expense ratio of just 0 6% think of Schwab as your future retirement that you can use to get peace of mind that gives you a solid foothold in the market with a mix of stability dividends and growth potential this ETF or exchange traded fund is like a carefully curated playlist of stocks across various sectors offering you a piece of the action in everything from Tech to healthcare but here's where it gets interesting what sets SCD apart is its focus on dividend growth meaning it specifically picks stocks that not only pay dividends but have the potential to increase those payouts over time all while keeping your cost low with its minimal expense ratio so investing in SD is like planting a seed that grows not just through the value of the ETF itself but through increasingly larger dividend checks without eating into your returns with high fees it's designed for those who are playing the long game looking for steady income and growth making it a standout option for building your investment or retirement portfolio in essence SCD is more than just an ETF it's a gateway to financial growth offering a balanced approach to earning from the markets ups and downs with the added perk of being incredibly cost-effective while always paying dividends let's break down why I love CHD and I think you'll see why it's not just any ETF on the market picture this SCD is currently trading at around $79 per share and it's near the all-time highs which beckons the question of can it go higher first we're looking at the big picture and having SD as a 30-year investment so in the overall scope today's price doesn't matter over a 30-year time frame and second the FED plans to lower interest rates which makes borrowing money cheaper for everyone including big companies for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that payout part for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that pay out part of their profits as dividends this is great news lower interest rates mean these companies can save money on their loans make more money because people are spending more and ultimately share more profits with their investors through bigger dividends dividend stocks especially those with stable and reliable payouts become more valuable to investors in a lower interest rate environment because investors are willing to pay more for the perceived safety and income generation of these stocks which is likely to lead to a higher stock price for SD but here's where it gets really exciting for conservative investors that desire a low-risk portfolio the top 10 Holdings ofd are stable stocks that have withstood the test of time Texas Instruments UPS Home Depot Black Rock Cisco Systems Pepsi Lockheed Martin fizer Chevron and Bristol Meyer squib it's a dividend lovers dream portfolio diving deeper SD sector exposure is brilliantly balanced with 17.12% in Industrials 16.73% in financials 15.9% in healthcare 11.95% in consumer staples 9.2 25% in energy and the rest are spread across various sectors this level of diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in just one basket even if a few stocks don't perform as expected the etf's broad coverage Shields you from significant impact now let's talk about dividends the trailing 12-month dividend yield is 3.41% which may not be that high but it is consistent in something we can likely count on for years to come here you can see SD's dividend growth over the last 10 years has been steadily increasing and you'll see why this is important when we start plugging the numbers into the dividend calculator I'm going to use conservative numbers today now one key figure we need is the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 11 years from 2013 to 2023 it's been 11.16% keep this 11.16% in mind because I'm going to be even more cautious and use 8% in the dividend calculator for the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year I want to make sure these numbers aren't confusing our next key figure is the stock appreciation since Inception SCD has increased by 212% which is about 19% per year however I think that's too high and not realistic to continue moving forward looking at the 5-year average it's 10.37% I'm going to be super conservative and use 6% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage in our calculations the key figures I'm using for both the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreci appreciation percentage in the dividend calculator are much lower than the historical averages I want to make sure you know where these numbers come from so you don't think I'm just making this stuff up I'm being extra conservative on purpose if you like how I'm breaking this down and being careful with the numbers let me know in the comments so I know to include these types of explanations in my future videos looking at the bigger picture with these conservative numbers I'm going to show you why SD is a great choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SD to purchase more shares this method allows you to supercharge growing your investment over the next 30 Years thanks to the power of compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the more it rolls the bigger it gets that's the secret behind Building Wealth with SCD now let me show you how just $50,000 in SD could beat your full-time job and retire you rich and if you feel I've earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button show some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has real-time Trading alerts and if you're interested in trying out my custom trading view indicators there's a free trial link below thanks and with that covered let's play with the dividend calculator so you can see the math let's get our dividend calculator set up first thing we want to come down to the distribution frequency and we want to change that to quarterly we want to make sure the drip is on so we're reinvesting our starting principal is going to be $50,000 dividend tax rate will'll leave that at 15% the initial annual dividend yield that's 3.41% are expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year is 8% and we just covered where that number came from the expected annual share price appreciation 6% and remember both of these numbers are conservative our years invested are 30 now let's go ahead and calculate the dividends in our first year we're starting with $50,000 in principal our annual dividend works out to $1,726 193 and if you look at the numbers they're not that impressive and that's completely normal after 5 years we're looking at principal of $7,695 annual dividend $2,631 10 years we're at $110,000 and $451 in dividends after 15 years now it's starting to get a little bit better $174,300 $785 in dividends dropping down to 20 years $280,000 with $3,893 in dividends 25 years $459,000 with over $255,000 in dividends and now you can see the cumulative effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a future where your investment support you is just not true with smart choices like SCD even a single investment of $50,000 or starting small and consistently growing your SD portfolio could grow to replace $50,000 in income over time patience and smart investing can make a huge difference let's recap our conservative numbers the $50,000 investment in CHD turned into $853,000 the total return is 1, 166% the average annual return is 99.92% after 30 years the annual dividend income is over $52,000 if you're curious ious about how the portfolio looks using the 5-year historical averages hang tight I'll share those numbers with you in just a moment today's video goes beyond just investing it's about making wise investment choices with an ETF known for its consistent dividend payouts and potential for share price growth if you're aiming for a financial GameChanger diving deeper into SCD could be the move that helps you build your financial future and sets you up for a great retirement don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community tab to stay a step ahead in the investment game [Music] name keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD Might Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a compelling long-term investment strategy to achieve financial independence and potentially replace a full-time job's income.

SCHD is highlighted for its exceptionally low 0.06% expense ratio and its focus on dividend *growth* stocks, selecting companies likely to increase payouts over time. Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",BlackRock,0.95,0.8

looking at the big picture and having SD as a 30-year investment so in the overall scope today's price doesn't matter over a 30-year time frame and second the FED plans to lower interest rates which makes borrowing money cheaper for everyone including big companies for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that payout part for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that pay out part of their profits as dividends this is great news lower interest rates mean these companies can save money on their loans make more money because people are spending more and ultimately share more profits with their investors through bigger dividends dividend stocks especially those with stable and reliable payouts become more valuable to investors in a lower interest rate environment because investors are willing to pay more for the perceived safety and income generation of these stocks which is likely to lead to a higher stock price for SD but here's where it gets really exciting for conservative investors that desire a low-risk portfolio the top 10 Holdings ofd are stable stocks that have withstood the test of time Texas Instruments UPS Home Depot Black Rock Cisco Systems Pepsi Lockheed Martin fizer Chevron and Bristol Meyer squib it's a dividend lovers dream portfolio diving deeper SD sector exposure is brilliantly balanced with 17.12% in Industrials 16.73% in financials 15.9% in healthcare 11.95% in consumer staples 9.2 25% in energy and the rest are spread across various sectors this level of diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in just one basket even if a few stocks don't perform as expected the etf's broad coverage Shields you from significant impact now let's talk about dividends the trailing 12-month dividend yield is 3.41% which may not be that high but it is consistent in something we can likely count on for years to come here you can see SD's dividend growth over the last 10 years has been steadily increasing and you'll see why this is important when we start plugging the numbers into the dividend calculator I'm going to use conservative numbers today now one key figure we need is the average yearly growth of the dividend payout over the last 11 years from 2013 to 2023 it's been 11.16% keep this 11.16% in mind because I'm going to be even more cautious and use 8% in the dividend calculator for the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year I want to make sure these numbers aren't confusing our next key figure is the stock appreciation since Inception SCD has increased by 212% which is about 19% per year however I think that's too high and not realistic to continue moving forward looking at the 5-year average it's 10.37% I'm going to be super conservative and use 6% for our expected annual share price appreciation percentage in our calculations the key figures I'm using for both the expected annual dividend amount increase percentage and expected annual share price appreci appreciation percentage in the dividend calculator are much lower than the historical averages I want to make sure you know where these numbers come from so you don't think I'm just making this stuff up I'm being extra conservative on purpose if you like how I'm breaking this down and being careful with the numbers let me know in the comments so I know to include these types of explanations in my future videos looking at the bigger picture with these conservative numbers I'm going to show you why SD is a great choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SD to purchase more shares this method allows you to supercharge growing your investment over the next 30 Years thanks to the power of compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the more it rolls the bigger it gets that's the secret behind Building Wealth with SCD now let me show you how just $50,000 in SD could beat your full-time job and retire you rich and if you feel I've earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button show some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has real-time Trading alerts and if you're interested in trying out my custom trading view indicators there's a free trial link below thanks and with that covered let's play with the dividend calculator so you can see the math let's get our dividend calculator set up first thing we want to come down to the distribution frequency and we want to change that to quarterly we want to make sure the drip is on so we're reinvesting our starting principal is going to be $50,000 dividend tax rate will'll leave that at 15% the initial annual dividend yield that's 3.41% are expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year is 8% and we just covered where that number came from the expected annual share price appreciation 6% and remember both of these numbers are conservative our years invested are 30 now let's go ahead and calculate the dividends in our first year we're starting with $50,000 in principal our annual dividend works out to $1,726 193 and if you look at the numbers they're not that impressive and that's completely normal after 5 years we're looking at principal of $7,695 annual dividend $2,631 10 years we're at $110,000 and $451 in dividends after 15 years now it's starting to get a little bit better $174,300 $785 in dividends dropping down to 20 years $280,000 with $3,893 in dividends 25 years $459,000 with over $255,000 in dividends and now you can see the cumulative effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a future where your investment support you is just not true with smart choices like SCD even a single investment of $50,000 or starting small and consistently growing your SD portfolio could grow to replace $50,000 in income over time patience and smart investing can make a huge difference let's recap our conservative numbers the $50,000 investment in CHD turned into $853,000 the total return is 1, 166% the average annual return is 99.92% after 30 years the annual dividend income is over $52,000 if you're curious ious about how the portfolio looks using the 5-year historical averages hang tight I'll share those numbers with you in just a moment today's video goes beyond just investing it's about making wise investment choices with an ETF known for its consistent dividend payouts and potential for share price growth if you're aiming for a financial GameChanger diving deeper into SCD could be the move that helps you build your financial future and sets you up for a great retirement don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community tab to stay a step ahead in the investment game [Music] name keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD Might Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a compelling long-term investment strategy to achieve financial independence and potentially replace a full-time job's income.

SCHD is highlighted for its exceptionally low 0.06% expense ratio and its focus on dividend *growth* stocks, selecting companies likely to increase payouts over time. Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",PepsiCo,0.95,0.8

annual share price appreci appreciation percentage in the dividend calculator are much lower than the historical averages I want to make sure you know where these numbers come from so you don't think I'm just making this stuff up I'm being extra conservative on purpose if you like how I'm breaking this down and being careful with the numbers let me know in the comments so I know to include these types of explanations in my future videos looking at the bigger picture with these conservative numbers I'm going to show you why SD is a great choice for long-term investors the real magic happens when you reinvest your dividends back into SD to purchase more shares this method allows you to supercharge growing your investment over the next 30 Years thanks to the power of compounding gains it's like rolling a snowball down a hill the more it rolls the bigger it gets that's the secret behind Building Wealth with SCD now let me show you how just $50,000 in SD could beat your full-time job and retire you rich and if you feel I've earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button show some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has real-time Trading alerts and if you're interested in trying out my custom trading view indicators there's a free trial link below thanks and with that covered let's play with the dividend calculator so you can see the math let's get our dividend calculator set up first thing we want to come down to the distribution frequency and we want to change that to quarterly we want to make sure the drip is on so we're reinvesting our starting principal is going to be $50,000 dividend tax rate will'll leave that at 15% the initial annual dividend yield that's 3.41% are expected annual dividend amount increase percentage per year is 8% and we just covered where that number came from the expected annual share price appreciation 6% and remember both of these numbers are conservative our years invested are 30 now let's go ahead and calculate the dividends in our first year we're starting with $50,000 in principal our annual dividend works out to $1,726 193 and if you look at the numbers they're not that impressive and that's completely normal after 5 years we're looking at principal of $7,695 annual dividend $2,631 10 years we're at $110,000 and $451 in dividends after 15 years now it's starting to get a little bit better $174,300 $785 in dividends dropping down to 20 years $280,000 with $3,893 in dividends 25 years $459,000 with over $255,000 in dividends and now you can see the cumulative effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a future where your investment support you is just not true with smart choices like SCD even a single investment of $50,000 or starting small and consistently growing your SD portfolio could grow to replace $50,000 in income over time patience and smart investing can make a huge difference let's recap our conservative numbers the $50,000 investment in CHD turned into $853,000 the total return is 1, 166% the average annual return is 99.92% after 30 years the annual dividend income is over $52,000 if you're curious ious about how the portfolio looks using the 5-year historical averages hang tight I'll share those numbers with you in just a moment today's video goes beyond just investing it's about making wise investment choices with an ETF known for its consistent dividend payouts and potential for share price growth if you're aiming for a financial GameChanger diving deeper into SCD could be the move that helps you build your financial future and sets you up for a great retirement don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community tab to stay a step ahead in the investment game [Music] name keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD Might Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a compelling long-term investment strategy to achieve financial independence and potentially replace a full-time job's income.

SCHD is highlighted for its exceptionally low 0.06% expense ratio and its focus on dividend *growth* stocks, selecting companies likely to increase payouts over time. Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",Pfizer,0.95,0.8

a solid foothold in the market with a mix of stability dividends and growth potential this ETF or exchange traded fund is like a carefully curated playlist of stocks across various sectors offering you a piece of the action in everything from Tech to healthcare but here's where it gets interesting what sets SCD apart is its focus on dividend growth meaning it specifically picks stocks that not only pay dividends but have the potential to increase those payouts over time all while keeping your cost low with its minimal expense ratio so investing in SD is like planting a seed that grows not just through the value of the ETF itself but through increasingly larger dividend checks without eating into your returns with high fees it's designed for those who are playing the long game looking

why it's not just any ETF on the market picture this SCD is currently trading at around $79 per share and it's near the all-time highs which beckons the question of can it go higher first we're looking at the big picture and having SD as a 30-year investment so in the overall scope today's price doesn't matter over a 30-year time frame and second the FED plans to lower interest rates which makes borrowing money cheaper for everyone including big companies for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that payout part for an ETF like SD which holds a bunch of these big companies that pay out part of their profits as dividends this is great news lower interest rates mean these companies can save money on their loans make more money because people are spending more and ultimately share more profits with their investors through bigger dividends dividend stocks especially those with stable and reliable payouts become more valuable to investors in a lower interest rate environment because investors are willing to pay more for the perceived safety and income generation of these stocks which is likely to lead to a higher stock price for SD but here's where it

dividend yield is 3.41% which may not be that high but it is consistent in something we can likely count on for years to come here you can see SD's dividend growth over the last 10 years has been

effect and big changes are happening and at the end of 30 years we're at $767,000 and $ 46,4 in dividends so to summarize our dividend portfolio after 30 years it's up to $852 1838 the total return 1, 166% average annual return return 99.92% and the annual dividend income is now $52,400 into SCD today so let's play with some different numbers let's go with $10,000 of starting principal and our annual contribution let's do $100 a month so that would be $1,200 per year we'll keep everything else the same if we're going to calculate the dividends now we're going to see still quite sizable after 30 years $374,000 a total return of 73% and our average annual return 7.24% let's say you can beef that up a little bit and go $200 a month so we're at $2,400 hit the calculate button and now we're looking at $577,000 a 6.72% annual return and the annual dividend income $35,200 a month which many of you guys can swing so that would be $3,600 a year and when we calculate dividends look at this $781,000 roughly a total return of 561 average annual return 6.5% not too bad and our annual dividend income is now up to $ 47,7 and now as a bonus I want to give you one more scenario I'm a real big fan of investing in tax advantage accounts so if you could do this in a Roth or a Roth 401k you wouldn't have any dividend tax rate and double check with your CPA on that so let's change that dividend tax rate to 0% and let's see how it changes our numbers all we do is hit the calculate dividends button and boom our ending balance is now $1,290 average annual return up 10.61% and our annual dividend income is $ 62,3 se8 guys if you can do this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k definitely seriously consider going that route playing with the dividend calculator is fascinating and while we can't know for sure how the next 30 Years will unfold I've chosen very conservative numbers compared to SD's past performance my conservative approach suggests there's a strong possibility that the actual results will be much higher here's a key Insight that strikes a chord with every investor whether you're well experienced or just beginning the belief that you need a massive Fortune to build a future where your investment support you is just not true with smart choices like SCD even a single investment of $50,000 or starting small and consistently growing your SD portfolio could grow to replace $50,000 in income over time patience and smart investing can make a huge difference let's recap our conservative numbers the $50,000 investment in CHD turned into $853,000 the total return is 1, 166% the average annual return is 99.92% after 30 years the annual dividend income is over $52,000 if you're curious ious about how the portfolio looks using the 5-year historical averages hang tight I'll share those numbers with you in just a moment today's video goes beyond just investing it's about making wise investment choices with an ETF known for its consistent dividend payouts and potential for share price growth if you're aiming for a financial GameChanger diving deeper into SCD could be the move that helps you build your financial future and sets you up for a great retirement don't forget to check out my daily pre-market insights on my YouTube Community tab to stay a step ahead in the investment game [Music] name keep it real and I'll catch you in the next video","The YouTube video ""$50,000 In SCHD Might Beat Your Full Time Job!"" strongly advocates for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a compelling long-term investment strategy to achieve financial independence and potentially replace a full-time job's income.

SCHD is highlighted for its exceptionally low 0.06% expense ratio and its focus on dividend *growth* stocks, selecting companies likely to increase payouts over time. Its appeal stems from a consistent 3.41% trailing dividend yield and an impressive 11.16% average annual dividend growth over the past 11 years (2013-2023). The ETF offers stability through diversified holdings in time-tested companies and is poised to benefit from anticipated lower interest rates. The video stresses the compounding power of dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as essential for supercharging growth.

A key projection demonstrates that a conservative initial $50,000 investment in SCHD, with dividends reinvested over 30 years (using projected 8% annual dividend growth and 6% share price appreciation), could grow to a portfolio value of $852,838, generating an annual dividend income of $52,477. The video also illustrates how smaller initial investments combined with consistent monthly contributions can lead to significant wealth. A critical bonus scenario emphasizes the substantial advantage of investing in tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA, where the same $50,000 investment over 30 years could yield over $1 million with an annual dividend income of $62,398 due to eliminated dividend taxes.

Overall, the video conveys that building wealth and achieving financial freedom through strategic, consistent investments like SCHD is achievable even without a massive fortune, underscoring the importance of patience, smart choices, and consistent investing, with conservative figures aiming for realistic and potentially understated projections.",Bristol Myers Squibb,0.95,0.8

reinvestment plan even though we don't have a dividend this method is aimed at those focusing on the Long Haul eager for steady income and growth it's an excellent strategy for enhancing your

you may have to sell your shares at the agreed upon price missing out on potential gains Above This threshold this strategy essentially allows you to rent your stocks for additional income with the limitation of capped potential profits considering paler closing price of $264 on Friday a 50,000 investment would allow us to buy approximately 1,920 shares given that one option contract covers 100 shares this allows us to sell 19 covered call contracts the question then becomes which covered call contract to sell my preference is for weekly options which paler has or you could do the monthly contracts it's advisable to choose a strike price above your purchase price understanding there's a balance between the strike price and the premium earned today we're opting for a 020 Delta offering a substantial premium with roughly a 20% chance that the call will be exercised meaning you might sell your stock at that strike price looking at the March 15th option chain we can see the 20 Delta is the $28 strike price and we can sell it for 24 cents per share which is $24 per contract let's dive into the specifics with my free option analyzer of available at Jerry mind.com we're now at my option analyzer and I think I gave you guys the wrong URL it's actually at beast mode analysis.com just click on option analyzer right here and it's completely free so the first thing we need to do is put in what we're buying so we're going to buy paler we're going to use Friday's closing date which was the 8th and the closing price was $264 and we're buying $1,920 shares and that's roughly $50,000 of stock next we need to put in our covered call so our stock is paler we're selling it on Friday days out are seven which gives us an expiration date of the 15th we're going to be doing that on 19 covered calls so that's 1,900 shares our share cost is what we paid for it 2604 and our covered call strike price is $28 and we're going to be receiving 24 cents per share and then our totaled is 456 and then we can come over here to our complete breakdown our adjusted cost basis is now now $4 49,53 180 and that's because we picked up the premium which adjusts our cost basis which shows right here our total weekly income is $456 the annualized ROI 47.4% estimated monthly income $1,976 and estimated annual income would be $237 and then coming down a little bit lower we can see our total wheel profits if closed would be 3,650 $59 so what does this mean well this means if the paler price goes up and closes over $28 then our calls will be exercised and then we make the profit from that price as well our total Roi if it's closed would be 7.32% but here's the crazy part over 7 Days the annualized ROI would be $381 60 and then here's a breakdown of everything by employing the 020 Delta strategy with a $50,000 investment in paler we're looking at generating $456 in weekly income which translates to approximately $1,976 per month considering my girlfriend and I managed to live luxuriously on less than $1,500 a month in Thailand having $50,000 could in theory allow you to retire immediately and if you live in the USA with a much higher cost of living hang on for part two however it's crucial to address the big disclaimer this model assumes consistent weekly earnings and a perpetually Rising stock Market reality though is less predictable some weeks might bring in higher returns others less while I'm optimistic about paler this approach can be adapted to any stock of your choosing my goal with today's video is to encourage informed investment decisions and strategic planning towards achieving Financial Independence aiming to keep it real so you can retire early and live now let's supercharge this strategy and I'll show you how to reinvest earnings from covered calls effectively utilizing them as you would in a dividend reinvestment plan and if you feel out earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button shows some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has realtime alerts and if you're curious about the indicators I use on trading view there's a free trial link down below thanks and with that out of the way let's use this strategy to grow a healthy retirement income please note no calculator can precisely predict the growth of this strategy I've demonstrated how we can achieve a 48% annualized Roi this week by purchasing paler at market price and selling a covered call for for visualization we'll use a dividend calculator and when you see dividend in this context simply think covered call First up Capital we're starting with $50,000 number two drip the dividend reinvestment plan we want to set that to yes to automatically reinvest our covered call earnings number three is distribution frequency adjusted to quarterly to accumulate enough funds for purchasing additional 100 share Lots though we're not dealing with dividends we're using a dividend calculator just for Simplicity so we can show the numbers number four the dividend tax rate we're going to set that at 35% and that's because covered call and profits are taxed like ordinary income your tax rate might vary so adjust it as needed number five initial annual dividend yield despite demonstrating a 48% annualized Roi from covered calls this week we'll use a conservative estimate of 15% for our annual yield six expected annual share price appreciation let's run with 10% for paler given that paler 50% rise year-to dat this is a very conservative assumption this framework allows us to conservatively project the growth of our investment using covered calls as a strategic tool for long-term wealth building let's go over our initial settings and remember we're doing covered calls but we have to use a dividend calculator so there will be some tweaks all right let's go over our calculator settings and again we're doing this on covered calls and there is no calculator that does this exact so we're just going to have to work with what we have on the dividend calculator so to start off we want to set our distribution frequency to semiannual the drip will be set to yes our starting principle we'll go ahead and put that at 50,000 dividend tax rate these are going to be covered calls taxed as ordinary income so we're going to put in 35% initial annual dividend yield 15% and that's this is our covered call again so this is what we're hoping to get on covered calls and I think that's very achievable and then our expected annual share price appreciation 10% per year years invested 30 and we're going to tweak this one in just a minute but for right now we're going to set this to zero so now we hit calculate dividends and we can see our ending balance would be $2,179 th000 and some change and if we scroll down here we can see our first year the principal is 50,000 our annual dividends this would be our covered call income would be $ 7,781 that would be a 15% yield and at the end of one year whenever we take into account the 15% yield as well as the share cost appreciation would be up to $60,500 and we could scroll down and look at our 10year amount our principal would be up to 206,000 uh New Balance over here would be 235,000 uh 20 years 688 768 pretty impressive and at the end of 30 years we're sitting at $197 million um for the principal balance and the New Balance would be $2.18 million now however we've got one problem with this and this is our yield the first year our yield was 15% the next year it goes down and down and that's because this is normal for dividends however we're going to be doing covered calls so we should be able to keep that yield right around 15% and what we need to do is change our expected annual dividend amount increase now remember we're on covered calls here so we're going to be able to hold that at a constant value and the way we do that to make it match would be we'd set this number to be the same as our share price increase and when we do that and hit calculate dividends I'm almost hesitant to show this number because it jumps so High our ending balance $112 million now if you come down here and we look at our chart we can see that the yield is now 15% and this would be our covered call yield each year so that way we're going to be growing in line with what our projections are and again these numbers are astronomical but don't get mad at me this is the math and what's possible now in the real world will this happen probably not there will be some different changes along the way but if we can get anywhere close well it would be doing okay and now to keep the numbers really conservative I switch this back down to zero but I want to show you one more advanced thing for you guys to consider I love to do investing in my retirement accounts they're all taxed advantaged if you can do it in an IRA it's going to be tax deferred if you can do it in a Roth IRA or Roth 401k it's going to be taxfree down the road so what we could do for the advanced guys that can do this in your retirement accounts let's change the dividend tax rate and let's assume that we're going to be doing this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k we're going to drop that down to 0% and now whenever we calculate look at how these numbers changed it went all the way up to $3.5 million for an ending balance and that's simply the difference on taxes so if you can do these sort of things in your retirement accounts definitely please consider doing that of course you always want to do your own due diligence and do what's best for you wrapping up our Deep dive into paler here's a powerful takeaway that resonates with every investor seasoned or just started out Building Wealth doesn't require huge amounts of capital our strategy with paler demonstrates two methods to generate substantial income potentially substituting $50,000 of annual income over time my optimism for paler sees it as a potential AI industry Titan like Google or Microsoft success isn't guaranteed this strategy may be viable with paler for one five or 10 years maybe more but the key is adaptability we can always find new stocks that fit our criteria and produce similar results and if you don't like paler as a company then find one that works for you paler highlights the effectiveness of a solid cupboard call strategy Amplified by the power of reinvesting our covered call profits and if you can do this in a tax deferred retirement account your profits will be considerably higher and here's the kicker the numbers I shared in the covered call reinvestment strategy they're on the conservative side I've used a much lower share appreciation rate for paler than their actual historical performance and a very conservative 15% yield for the covered call Strat straty so imagine the results it could reach with the real numbers now let's tackle three common questions on covered calls one weekly versus monthly covered calls can you op for either weekly or monthly covered calls absolutely my preference leans towards weekly covered calls why they tend to be slightly more profitable this is because options lose value quicker as they near expiration a beneficial aspect for us when selling the covered calls number two dealing with a drop in stock price what if the stocks price Falls below your purchase cost you can still still engage in selling covered calls be aware this approach is more advanced and requires careful consideration I'm open to diving deeper into this topic in the future if there's enough strong interest let me know down below and number three why does the annual yield decrease in the calculation table the decrease in yield is due to the calculator's Assumption of an increasing stock price over time when we input a 15% yield Target remember that yield is calculated as the annual returns from covered calls divided by the Stock's price therefore as the stocks price climbs maintaining a fixed 15% yield results in a decreasing yield percentage over the years today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video is inspired some critical thinking about today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video has inspired some critical thinking and maybe I've opened your eyes to the possibilities with covered calls to access real-time trade alerts consider joining my patreon community for those interested in the trading indicators I use on trading view check out the free trial link provided below keep it real peace","This YouTube transcript segment details an investment strategy centered on using Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to generate income via covered calls, aiming to potentially replace a full-time job. The speaker recommends this strategy, viewing Palantir as a prospective ""AI industry Titan.""

The approach involves owning PLTR shares and selling weekly call options against them to earn premiums. As an example, a $50,000 investment (approx. 1,920 shares) could yield an estimated $23,712 annually, representing a 47.4% annualized ROI, by selling 19 weekly contracts at a $28 strike. For long-term wealth building, the strategy emphasizes reinvesting these earnings, which, combined with conservative share appreciation and tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA), could theoretically grow a $50,000 initial investment to over $3.5 million in 30 years.

The speaker highlights that the actual demonstrated ROI and Palantir's historical appreciation exceed his conservative long-term projections, suggesting even greater potential. While characterizing covered calls as ""low-risk"" (a subjective assessment), the core message is that wealth can be built without vast capital by leveraging suitable stocks, covered calls, reinvestment, and tax advantages, with the strategy being adaptable to other equities.",Palantir,1.0,1.0

covered call again so this is what we're hoping to get on covered calls and I think that's very achievable and then our expected annual share price appreciation 10% per year years invested 30 and we're going to tweak this one in just a minute but for right now we're going to set this to zero so now we hit calculate dividends and we can see our ending balance would be $2,179 th000 and some change and if we scroll down here we can see our first year the principal is 50,000 our annual dividends this would be our covered call income would be $ 7,781 that would be a 15% yield and at the end of one year whenever we take into account the 15% yield as well as the share cost appreciation would be up to $60,500 and we could scroll down and look at our 10year amount our principal would be up to 206,000 uh New Balance over here would be 235,000 uh 20 years 688 768 pretty impressive and at the end of 30 years we're sitting at $197 million um for the principal balance and the New Balance would be $2.18 million now however we've got one problem with this and this is our yield the first year our yield was 15% the next year it goes down and down and that's because this is normal for dividends however we're going to be doing covered calls so we should be able to keep that yield right around 15% and what we need to do is change our expected annual dividend amount increase now remember we're on covered calls here so we're going to be able to hold that at a constant value and the way we do that to make it match would be we'd set this number to be the same as our share price increase and when we do that and hit calculate dividends I'm almost hesitant to show this number because it jumps so High our ending balance $112 million now if you come down here and we look at our chart we can see that the yield is now 15% and this would be our covered call yield each year so that way we're going to be growing in line with what our projections are and again these numbers are astronomical but don't get mad at me this is the math and what's possible now in the real world will this happen probably not there will be some different changes along the way but if we can get anywhere close well it would be doing okay and now to keep the numbers really conservative I switch this back down to zero but I want to show you one more advanced thing for you guys to consider I love to do investing in my retirement accounts they're all taxed advantaged if you can do it in an IRA it's going to be tax deferred if you can do it in a Roth IRA or Roth 401k it's going to be taxfree down the road so what we could do for the advanced guys that can do this in your retirement accounts let's change the dividend tax rate and let's assume that we're going to be doing this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k we're going to drop that down to 0% and now whenever we calculate look at how these numbers changed it went all the way up to $3.5 million for an ending balance and that's simply the difference on taxes so if you can do these sort of things in your retirement accounts definitely please consider doing that of course you always want to do your own due diligence and do what's best for you wrapping up our Deep dive into paler here's a powerful takeaway that resonates with every investor seasoned or just started out Building Wealth doesn't require huge amounts of capital our strategy with paler demonstrates two methods to generate substantial income potentially substituting $50,000 of annual income over time my optimism for paler sees it as a potential AI industry Titan like Google or Microsoft success isn't guaranteed this strategy may be viable with paler for one five or 10 years maybe more but the key is adaptability we can always find new stocks that fit our criteria and produce similar results and if you don't like paler as a company then find one that works for you paler highlights the effectiveness of a solid cupboard call strategy Amplified by the power of reinvesting our covered call profits and if you can do this in a tax deferred retirement account your profits will be considerably higher and here's the kicker the numbers I shared in the covered call reinvestment strategy they're on the conservative side I've used a much lower share appreciation rate for paler than their actual historical performance and a very conservative 15% yield for the covered call Strat straty so imagine the results it could reach with the real numbers now let's tackle three common questions on covered calls one weekly versus monthly covered calls can you op for either weekly or monthly covered calls absolutely my preference leans towards weekly covered calls why they tend to be slightly more profitable this is because options lose value quicker as they near expiration a beneficial aspect for us when selling the covered calls number two dealing with a drop in stock price what if the stocks price Falls below your purchase cost you can still still engage in selling covered calls be aware this approach is more advanced and requires careful consideration I'm open to diving deeper into this topic in the future if there's enough strong interest let me know down below and number three why does the annual yield decrease in the calculation table the decrease in yield is due to the calculator's Assumption of an increasing stock price over time when we input a 15% yield Target remember that yield is calculated as the annual returns from covered calls divided by the Stock's price therefore as the stocks price climbs maintaining a fixed 15% yield results in a decreasing yield percentage over the years today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video is inspired some critical thinking about today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video has inspired some critical thinking and maybe I've opened your eyes to the possibilities with covered calls to access real-time trade alerts consider joining my patreon community for those interested in the trading indicators I use on trading view check out the free trial link provided below keep it real peace","This YouTube transcript segment details an investment strategy centered on using Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to generate income via covered calls, aiming to potentially replace a full-time job. The speaker recommends this strategy, viewing Palantir as a prospective ""AI industry Titan.""

The approach involves owning PLTR shares and selling weekly call options against them to earn premiums. As an example, a $50,000 investment (approx. 1,920 shares) could yield an estimated $23,712 annually, representing a 47.4% annualized ROI, by selling 19 weekly contracts at a $28 strike. For long-term wealth building, the strategy emphasizes reinvesting these earnings, which, combined with conservative share appreciation and tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA), could theoretically grow a $50,000 initial investment to over $3.5 million in 30 years.

The speaker highlights that the actual demonstrated ROI and Palantir's historical appreciation exceed his conservative long-term projections, suggesting even greater potential. While characterizing covered calls as ""low-risk"" (a subjective assessment), the core message is that wealth can be built without vast capital by leveraging suitable stocks, covered calls, reinvestment, and tax advantages, with the strategy being adaptable to other equities.",Google,1.0,0.5

reinvestment plan even though we don't have a dividend this method is aimed at those focusing on the Long Haul eager for steady income and growth it's an excellent strategy for enhancing your long-term Investment Portfolio our first strategy involves investing 50,000 in paler and employing a covered call approach a covered call is an stop a covered call is an investment technique for stock owners looking to earnt extra income it involves owning or purchasing shares then selling the option to buy these shares at a predetermined price in the future this sale earns you an upfront fee which is yours regardless of outcomes if the Stock's price remains under this predetermined price when the option expires you retain both your shares and the fee however if the stock price exceeds the limit you may have to sell your shares at the agreed upon price missing out on potential gains Above This threshold this strategy essentially allows you to rent your stocks for additional income with the limitation of capped potential profits considering paler closing price of $264 on Friday a 50,000 investment would allow us to buy approximately 1,920 shares given that one option contract covers 100 shares this allows us to sell 19 covered call contracts the question then becomes which covered call contract to sell my preference is for weekly options which paler has or you could do the monthly contracts it's advisable to choose a strike price above your purchase price understanding there's a balance between the strike price and the premium earned today we're opting for a 020 Delta offering a substantial premium with roughly a 20% chance that the call will be exercised meaning you might sell your stock at that strike price looking at the March 15th option chain we can see the 20 Delta is the $28 strike price and we can sell it for 24 cents per share which is $24 per contract let's dive into the specifics with my free option analyzer of available at Jerry mind.com we're now at my option analyzer and I think I gave you guys the wrong URL it's actually at beast mode analysis.com just click on option analyzer right here and it's completely free so the first thing we need to do is put in what we're buying so we're going to buy paler we're going to use Friday's closing date which was the 8th and the closing price was $264 and we're buying $1,920 shares and that's roughly $50,000 of stock next we need to put in our covered call so our stock is paler we're selling it on Friday days out are seven which gives us an expiration date of the 15th we're going to be doing that on 19 covered calls so that's 1,900 shares our share cost is what we paid for it 2604 and our covered call strike price is $28 and we're going to be receiving 24 cents per share and then our totaled is 456 and then we can come over here to our complete breakdown our adjusted cost basis is now now $4 49,53 180 and that's because we picked up the premium which adjusts our cost basis which shows right here our total weekly income is $456 the annualized ROI 47.4% estimated monthly income $1,976 and estimated annual income would be $237 and then coming down a little bit lower we can see our total wheel profits if closed would be 3,650 $59 so what does this mean well this means if the paler price goes up and closes over $28 then our calls will be exercised and then we make the profit from that price as well our total Roi if it's closed would be 7.32% but here's the crazy part over 7 Days the annualized ROI would be $381 60 and then here's a breakdown of everything by employing the 020 Delta strategy with a $50,000 investment in paler we're looking at generating $456 in weekly income which translates to approximately $1,976 per month considering my girlfriend and I managed to live luxuriously on less than $1,500 a month in Thailand having $50,000 could in theory allow you to retire immediately and if you live in the USA with a much higher cost of living hang on for part two however it's crucial to address the big disclaimer this model assumes consistent weekly earnings and a perpetually Rising stock Market reality though is less predictable some weeks might bring in higher returns others less while I'm optimistic about paler this approach can be adapted to any stock of your choosing my goal with today's video is to encourage informed investment decisions and strategic planning towards achieving Financial Independence aiming to keep it real so you can retire early and live now let's supercharge this strategy and I'll show you how to reinvest earnings from

videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has realtime alerts and if you're curious about the indicators I use on trading view there's a free trial link down below thanks and with that out of the way let's use this strategy to grow a healthy retirement income please note no calculator can precisely predict the growth of this strategy I've demonstrated how we can achieve a 48% annualized Roi this week by purchasing paler at market price and selling a covered call for for visualization we'll use a dividend calculator and when you see dividend in this context simply think covered call First up Capital we're starting with $50,000 number two drip the dividend reinvestment plan we want to set that to yes to automatically reinvest our covered call earnings number three is distribution frequency adjusted to quarterly to accumulate enough funds for purchasing additional 100 share Lots though we're not dealing with dividends we're using a dividend calculator just for Simplicity so we can show the numbers number four the dividend tax rate we're going to set that at 35% and that's because covered call and profits are taxed like ordinary income your tax rate might vary so adjust it as needed number five initial annual dividend yield despite demonstrating a 48% annualized Roi from covered calls this week we'll use a conservative estimate of 15% for our annual yield six expected annual share price appreciation let's run with 10% for paler given that paler 50% rise year-to dat this is a very conservative assumption this framework allows us to conservatively project the growth of our investment using covered calls as a strategic tool for long-term wealth building let's go over our initial settings and remember we're doing covered calls but we have to use a dividend calculator so there will be some tweaks all right let's go over our calculator settings and again we're doing this on covered calls and there is no calculator that does this exact so we're just going to have to work with what we have on the dividend calculator so to start off we want to set our distribution frequency to semiannual the drip will be set to yes our starting principle we'll go ahead and put that at 50,000 dividend tax rate these are going to be covered calls taxed as ordinary income so we're going to put in 35% initial annual dividend yield 15% and that's this is our covered call again so this is what we're hoping to get on covered calls and I think that's very achievable and then our expected annual share price appreciation 10% per year years invested 30 and

Simplicity so we can show the numbers number four the dividend tax rate we're going to set that at 35% and that's because covered call and profits are taxed like ordinary income your tax rate might vary so adjust it as needed number five initial annual dividend yield despite demonstrating a 48% annualized Roi from covered calls this week we'll use a conservative estimate of 15% for our annual yield six expected annual share price appreciation let's run with 10% for paler given that paler 50% rise year-to dat this is a very conservative assumption this framework allows us to conservatively project the growth of our investment using covered calls as a strategic tool for long-term wealth building let's go over our initial settings and remember we're doing covered calls but we have to use a dividend calculator so there will be some tweaks all right let's go over our calculator settings and again we're doing this on covered calls and there is no calculator that does this exact so we're just going to have to work with what we have on the dividend calculator so to start off we want to set our distribution frequency to semiannual the drip will be set to yes our starting principle we'll go ahead and put that at 50,000 dividend tax rate these are going to be covered calls taxed as ordinary income so we're going to put in 35% initial annual dividend yield 15% and that's this is our covered call again so this is what we're hoping to get on covered calls and I think that's very achievable and then our expected annual share price appreciation 10% per year years invested 30 and we're going to tweak this one in just a minute but for right now we're going to set this to zero so now we hit calculate dividends and we can see our ending balance would be $2,179 th000 and some change and if we scroll down here we can see our first year the principal is 50,000 our annual dividends this would be our covered call income would be $ 7,781 that would be a 15% yield and at the end of one year whenever we take into account the 15% yield as well as the share cost appreciation would be up to $60,500 and we could scroll down and look at our 10year amount our principal would be up to 206,000 uh New Balance over here would be 235,000 uh 20 years 688 768 pretty impressive and at the end of 30 years we're sitting at $197 million um for the principal balance and the New Balance would be $2.18 million now however we've got one problem with this and this is our yield the first year our yield was 15% the next year it goes down and down and that's because this is normal for dividends however we're going to be doing covered calls so we should be able to keep that yield right around 15% and what we need to do is change our expected annual dividend amount increase now remember we're on covered calls here so we're going to be able to hold that at a constant value and the way we do that to make it match would be we'd set this number to be the same as our share price increase and when we do that and hit calculate dividends I'm almost hesitant to show this number because it jumps so High our ending balance $112 million now if you come down here and we look at our chart we can see that the yield is now 15% and this would be our covered call yield each year so that way we're going to be growing in line with what our projections are and again these numbers are astronomical but don't get mad at me this is the math and what's possible now in the real world will this happen probably not there will be some different changes along the way but if we can get anywhere close well it would be doing okay and now to keep the numbers really conservative I switch this back down to zero but I want to show you one more advanced thing for you guys to consider I love to do investing in my retirement accounts they're all taxed advantaged if you can do it in an IRA it's going to be tax deferred if you can do it in a Roth IRA or Roth 401k it's going to be taxfree down the road so what we could do for the advanced guys that can do this in your retirement accounts let's change the dividend tax rate and let's assume that we're going to be doing this in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k we're going to drop that down to 0% and now whenever we calculate look at how these numbers changed it went all the way up to $3.5 million for an ending balance and that's simply the difference on taxes so if you can do these sort of things in your retirement accounts definitely please consider doing that of course you always want to do your own due diligence and do what's best for you wrapping up our Deep dive into paler here's a powerful takeaway that resonates with every investor seasoned or just started out Building Wealth doesn't require huge amounts of capital our strategy with paler demonstrates two methods to generate substantial income potentially substituting $50,000 of annual income over time my optimism for paler sees it as a potential AI industry Titan like Google or Microsoft success isn't guaranteed this strategy may be viable with paler for one five or 10 years maybe more but the key is adaptability we can always find new stocks that fit our criteria and produce similar results and if you don't like paler as a company then find one that works for you paler highlights the effectiveness of a solid cupboard call strategy Amplified by the power of reinvesting our covered call profits and if you can do this in a tax deferred retirement account your profits will be considerably higher and here's the kicker the numbers I shared in the covered call reinvestment strategy they're on the conservative side I've used a much lower share appreciation rate for paler than their actual historical performance and a very conservative 15% yield for the covered call Strat straty so imagine the results it could reach with the real numbers now let's tackle three common questions on covered calls one weekly versus monthly covered calls can you op for either weekly or monthly covered calls absolutely my preference leans towards weekly covered calls why they tend to be slightly more profitable this is because options lose value quicker as they near expiration a beneficial aspect for us when selling the covered calls number two dealing with a drop in stock price what if the stocks price Falls below your purchase cost you can still still engage in selling covered calls be aware this approach is more advanced and requires careful consideration I'm open to diving deeper into this topic in the future if there's enough strong interest let me know down below and number three why does the annual yield decrease in the calculation table the decrease in yield is due to the calculator's Assumption of an increasing stock price over time when we input a 15% yield Target remember that yield is calculated as the annual returns from covered calls divided by the Stock's price therefore as the stocks price climbs maintaining a fixed 15% yield results in a decreasing yield percentage over the years today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video is inspired some critical thinking about today's video isn't just about investing it's about smart long-term investing and utilizing lowrisk covered calls to grow your income or retirement portfolios hopefully my video has inspired some critical thinking and maybe I've opened your eyes to the possibilities with covered calls to

peace","This YouTube transcript segment details an investment strategy centered on using Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to generate income via covered calls, aiming to potentially replace a full-time job. The speaker recommends this strategy, viewing Palantir as a prospective ""AI industry Titan.""

The approach involves owning PLTR shares and selling weekly call options against them to earn premiums. As an example, a $50,000 investment (approx. 1,920 shares) could yield an estimated $23,712 annually, representing a 47.4% annualized ROI, by selling 19 weekly contracts at a $28 strike. For long-term wealth building, the strategy emphasizes reinvesting these earnings, which, combined with conservative share appreciation and tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA), could theoretically grow a $50,000 initial investment to over $3.5 million in 30 years.

The speaker highlights that the actual demonstrated ROI and Palantir's historical appreciation exceed his conservative long-term projections, suggesting even greater potential. While characterizing covered calls as ""low-risk"" (a subjective assessment), the core message is that wealth can be built without vast capital by leveraging suitable stocks, covered calls, reinvestment, and tax advantages, with the strategy being adaptable to other equities.",Patreon,0.8,0.0

#stockmarket #stocks #financialeducation","Kind: captions Language: en dreaming of replacing your 9 to-5 income with investment returns that goal may be closer than you think especially with a Strategic investment in paler Technologies known by its ticker symbol pltr imagine turning a $50,000 investment into a primary income Source sounds ambitious let's explore how this is not just feasible but surprisingly straightforward your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one an introduction to paler Technologies a quick overview of paler role in Ai and decision- making across sectors and why it's a strong candidate for investment number two investment strategies with paler a detailed exploration of a strategy with a $50,000 investment in paler aiming to replace a full-time income number three real world application a practical guide on generating steady income through a time- tested proven strategy and number four how to build a retirement income using today's strategy for long-term wealth building with conservative projections for investment growth and tips for maximizing returns and if you're new here don't forget to hit that subscribe button and ring the bell so you never miss an [Music] update first let's dive into a straightforward strategy you can apply today boasting a potential annual Roi of 47.4% before doubt set in let me clarify all calculations are based on real world data including the bid spread and ask prices for paler stock and options on the date of this video These numbers are not make believe these are the real numbers right now and it's important to note that outcomes will fluctuate and we have to expect good and bad weeks today's figures suggest a 47.4% annualized ro however for a conservative approach consider this an optimistic scenario next we'll explore how to adapt this strategy with a slight twist treating it as a long-term dividend reinvestment plan even though we don't have a dividend this method is aimed at those focusing on the Long Haul eager for steady income and growth it's an excellent strategy for enhancing your long-term Investment Portfolio our first strategy involves investing 50,000 in paler and employing a covered call approach a covered call is an stop a covered call is an investment technique for stock owners looking to earnt extra income it involves owning or purchasing shares then selling the option to buy these shares at a predetermined price in the future this sale earns you an upfront fee which is yours regardless of outcomes if the Stock's price remains under this predetermined price when the option expires you retain both your shares and the fee however if the stock price exceeds the limit you may have to sell your shares at the agreed upon price missing out on potential gains Above This threshold this strategy essentially allows you to rent your stocks for additional income with the limitation of capped potential profits considering paler closing price of $264 on Friday a 50,000 investment would allow us to buy approximately 1,920 shares given that one option contract covers 100 shares this allows us to sell 19 covered call contracts the question then becomes which covered call contract to sell my preference is for weekly options which paler has or you could do the monthly contracts it's advisable to choose a strike price above your purchase price understanding there's a balance between the strike price and the premium earned today we're opting for a 020 Delta offering a substantial premium with roughly a 20% chance that the call will be exercised meaning you might sell your stock at that strike price looking at the March 15th option chain we can see the 20 Delta is the $28 strike price and we can sell it for 24 cents per share which is $24 per contract let's dive into the specifics with my free option analyzer of available at Jerry mind.com we're now at my option analyzer and I think I gave you guys the wrong URL it's actually at beast mode analysis.com just click on option analyzer right here and it's completely free so the first thing we need to do is put in what we're buying so we're going to buy paler we're going to use Friday's closing date which was the 8th and the closing price was $264 and we're buying $1,920 shares and that's roughly $50,000 of stock next we need to put in our covered call so our stock is paler we're selling it on Friday days out are seven which gives us an expiration date of the 15th we're going to be doing that on 19 covered calls so that's 1,900 shares our share cost is what we paid for it 2604 and our covered call strike price is $28 and we're going to be receiving 24 cents per share and then our totaled is 456 and then we can come over here to our complete breakdown our adjusted cost basis is now now $4 49,53 180 and that's because we picked up the premium which adjusts our cost basis which shows right here our total weekly income is $456 the annualized ROI 47.4% estimated monthly income $1,976 and estimated annual income would be $237 and then coming down a little bit lower we can see our total wheel profits if closed would be 3,650 $59 so what does this mean well this means if the paler price goes up and closes over $28 then our calls will be exercised and then we make the profit from that price as well our total Roi if it's closed would be 7.32% but here's the crazy part over 7 Days the annualized ROI would be $381 60 and then here's a breakdown of everything by employing the 020 Delta strategy with a $50,000 investment in paler we're looking at generating $456 in weekly income which translates to approximately $1,976 per month considering my girlfriend and I managed to live luxuriously on less than $1,500 a month in Thailand having $50,000 could in theory allow you to retire immediately and if you live in the USA with a much higher cost of living hang on for part two however it's crucial to address the big disclaimer this model assumes consistent weekly earnings and a perpetually Rising stock Market reality though is less predictable some weeks might bring in higher returns others less while I'm optimistic about paler this approach can be adapted to any stock of your choosing my goal with today's video is to encourage informed investment decisions and strategic planning towards achieving Financial Independence aiming to keep it real so you can retire early and live now let's supercharge this strategy and I'll show you how to reinvest earnings from covered calls effectively utilizing them as you would in a dividend reinvestment plan and if you feel out earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button shows some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has realtime alerts and if you're curious about the indicators I use on trading view there's a free trial link down below thanks and with that out of the way let's use this strategy to grow a healthy retirement income please note no calculator can precisely predict the growth of this strategy I've demonstrated how we can achieve a 48% annualized Roi this week by purchasing paler at market price and selling a covered call for for visualization we'll use a dividend calculator and when you see dividend in this context simply think covered call First up Capital we're starting with $50,000 number two drip the dividend reinvestment plan we want to set that to yes to automatically reinvest our covered call earnings number three is distribution frequency adjusted to quarterly to accumulate enough funds for purchasing additional 100 share Lots though we're not dealing with dividends we're using a dividend calculator just for

think today we're diving into the JP Morgan NASDAQ Equity premium income ETF better known as ticker symbol jeq and showing you how an initial $50,000 investment could potentially outpace your full-time job's income and just to be clear JP Morgan has two dividend ETFs the more well-known ji and the newer JQ which will be our Focus today your time is valuable and I'm not going to keep you hostage here's everything we're going to talk about today number one we'll explore the JQ ETF and dive into what it is its low expense ratio and its dividend growth Focus number two we'll cover why jeq excites me and discuss its performance the tech sector potential and the high dividend yield number three we'll go over a real world example and illustrate how $50,000 in this ETF could outperform your full-time job through dividends and growth and and number four I'll wrap up with a summary of jq's benefits as an investment emphasizing its potential to replace a significant income stream and why it might be a smart choice for your Investment Portfolio and if you're new here don't forget to hit that subscribe button and ring the bell so you never miss an update all right let's dive into what jpq ETF really is and what it does with a Twist that makes it even more compelling its impressively low expense ratio of just. 35% think of jpq as your financial multi-tool designed not just for the seasoned investor but for anyone looking to get a foothold in the market with a mix of stability and growth potential this ETF or exchange traded fund is like a carefully curated playlist of stocks across various sectors offering you a piece of the action in everything from Tech to healthcare but here's where it gets really interesting what sets jpq apart is its focus on dividend growth meaning it specifically picks stocks that not only pay dividends but have the potential to increase those payouts over time all while keeping your cost low with its minimal expense ratio and they also do covered calls to further add to the dividend income so investing in jpq is like planting a seed that grows not just through the value of the ETF itself but through increasingly larger dividend checks without eating into your returns with high fees it's designed for those who are playing the long game looking for steady income and growth making it a standout option for building your Investment Portfolio in essence jeq is more than just an ETF it's a gateway to financial growth offering a balanced approach to earning from the markets ups and downs with the added perk of being incredibly cost effective let's break down why I love jpq and I think you'll see why it's not just any ETF on the market picture this jpq is currently trading at around $53 per share now with AI and Tech sectors expected to explode in 24 I find this price not just comfortable but incredibly promising in the past year alone jpq has surged by 25% and that's before we even factor in the dividends here's where it gets really exciting for Tech enthusiasts like myself the top 10 Holdings of JQ are like the who who of the tech World Microsoft Apple Nvidia Amazon meta Google broadcom AMD Tesla and Netflix it's a tech lovers dream portfolio and Diving deeper jpq sector exposure is brilliantly balanced with 41% in information technology 133% in Communications 11.9% in consumer discretionary and the rest spread across various sectors this level of diversification means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket even if a few stocks don't perform as expected the etf's broad coverage Shields you from significant impact now let's talk dividends a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 12.51% is just phenomenal completely overshadowing more traditional options like SCD which stands at just 3.41% when you look at the combination of dividend yield and stock appreciation it's a compelling argument for jeq compared Tod's Total return of 7.2% jeq boasts a total return of 37.2 two% granted jeq has only been around since 2022 giving us just two years of dividend history but what a start it's been the performance so far is nothing short of outstanding in a nutshell jpq isn't just a part of my portfolio it's a testament to where I believe the market is headed especially in the tech sector with its strategic Holdings impressive returns and exceptional dividend yield it's hard not to be bullish about what lies ahead for this ETF and now let me show you how just 50,000 in JQ could beat your full-time job and retire you rich and if you feeli I've earned it a quick hit on the like And subscribe button shows some love and support for my videos and for those diving deeper into trading my patreon has realtime alerts and if you're curious about the indicators I use on trading view there's a free trial link below thanks and with that out of the way let me show you the dividend calculator so you can see the math now let's go through our dividend calculator you want to go ahead and set up the distribution frequency to monthly because that's what it is for jpq we want the drip so the Dividends are automatically reinvested our starting principle we want that to be $50,000 and then our initial annual dividend yield we're going to go ahead and put that at 9% which is lower than what jbq has actually had historically our expected annual dividend amount increase that's going to be 4% and of course this number will vary and then the expected annual share price appreciation per year we're going to put 8% which is lower than I expect and even lower than what the

highly promising investment for income generation, asserting that an initial $50,000 could potentially yield income surpassing a full-time job. JEPQ is characterized by a low 0.35% expense ratio, a strategy combining investments in dividend-growth stocks with covered calls, and a portfolio heavily weighted in major tech firms like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. Key performance indicators include a 25% price surge (excluding dividends) and an impressive 12.51% trailing 12-month dividend yield, contributing to a 37.22% total return that has significantly outperformed peers like SCHD despite JEPQ's relatively short two-year history. Illustrative projections show substantial annual dividend income potential over 30 years, ranging from significant amounts under conservative assumptions (9% initial yield, 4% dividend growth, 8% share price appreciation) to over $95,000 annually with more realistic assumptions (10% share price appreciation, 6% dividend growth).

that's going to be 4% and of course this number will vary and then the expected annual share price appreciation per year we're going to put 8% which is lower than I expect and even lower than what the S&amp;P 500 gets and then our year invested will be 30 years and now we want to calculate those dividends with year one we started with $50,000 in principal our annual dividends will be $4,690 and now coming down to year five you'll see that it's grown to $89,500 dropping down to year 10 we have $1 173,880 in principal annual Dividends are now up to $1,473 over at year 15 we're up to $323,900

now $51,000 and now let me give you guys an advanced tip and show you a few more things now I know most people can't drop $50,000 into a Roth IRA unless they use a backd door Roth but let's just say

numbers for the expected annual dividend amount increase it's very common that ETFs will increase the dividends to keep Pace with inflation so let's say inflation is cruising along at about 6% and our expected annual share price appreciation we went with 8% which I believe is low let's say we just keep Pace with the S&amp;P 500 which historically has been 10% now we're going to hit calculate

highly promising investment for income generation, asserting that an initial $50,000 could potentially yield income surpassing a full-time job. JEPQ is characterized by a low 0.35% expense ratio, a strategy combining investments in dividend-growth stocks with covered calls, and a portfolio heavily weighted in major tech firms like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. Key performance indicators include a 25% price surge (excluding dividends) and an impressive 12.51% trailing 12-month dividend yield, contributing to a 37.22% total return that has significantly outperformed peers like SCHD despite JEPQ's relatively short two-year history. Illustrative projections show substantial annual dividend income potential over 30 years, ranging from significant amounts under conservative assumptions (9% initial yield, 4% dividend growth, 8% share price appreciation) to over $95,000 annually with more realistic assumptions (10% share price appreciation, 6% dividend growth).

that's going to be 4% and of course this number will vary and then the expected annual share price appreciation per year we're going to put 8% which is lower than I expect and even lower than what the S&amp;P 500 gets and then our year invested will be 30 years and now we want to calculate those dividends with year one we started with $50,000 in principal our annual dividends will be $4,690 and now coming down to year five you'll see that it's grown to $89,500 dropping down to year 10 we have $1 173,880 in principal annual Dividends are now up to $1,473 over at year 15 we're up to $323,900

now $51,000 and now let me give you guys an advanced tip and show you a few more things now I know most people can't drop $50,000 into a Roth IRA unless they use a backd door Roth but let's just say

numbers for the expected annual dividend amount increase it's very common that ETFs will increase the dividends to keep Pace with inflation so let's say inflation is cruising along at about 6% and our

highly promising investment for income generation, asserting that an initial $50,000 could potentially yield income surpassing a full-time job. JEPQ is characterized by a low 0.35% expense ratio, a strategy combining investments in dividend-growth stocks with covered calls, and a portfolio heavily weighted in major tech firms like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. Key performance indicators include a 25% price surge (excluding dividends) and an impressive 12.51% trailing 12-month dividend yield, contributing to a 37.22% total return that has significantly outperformed peers like SCHD despite JEPQ's relatively short two-year history. Illustrative projections show substantial annual dividend income potential over 30 years, ranging from significant amounts under conservative assumptions (9% initial yield, 4% dividend growth, 8% share price appreciation) to over $95,000 annually with more realistic assumptions (10% share price appreciation, 6% dividend growth).

diving Straight Into the Heart of option trading understanding option prices an options price known as the premium isn't just a random figure it's a carefully calculated number that holds the key to your trading strategy the premium is the price price you pay for the potential to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price and it's influenced by a variety of Market factors think of it as a ticket to the options trading game the cost of your entry into a world of potential profits and strategic plays this premium the life blood of options trading is a blend of intrinsic and extrinsic value intrinsic value is like the solid gold at the core of your option it's the real tangible worth based on the current stock price compared to the option strike price if you're looking at a call option and the stock soaring above the strike price that's intrinsic value in action on the flip side extrinsic value is the speculative part of the premium often seen as the time value it reflects the potential for an option to become profitable over time considering factors like time left until expiration and Market volatility it's the high octane fuel that drives an options price Beyond its current worth offering a glimpse into the future potential of your investment intrinsic value is the Cornerstone of understanding option prices representing the actual tangible value of an option based on the current market conditions it's very straightforward for call options if the stock price is above the option strike price the option has intrinsic value for instance if you hold a call option with a strike price of $50 and a stock is currently trading at $55 the intrinsic value is $5 this $5 isn't just a number it's the real value that reflects the options profit potential if exercised at that moment intrinsic value is exclusive to in the money options those with a strike price favorably different from the current stock price it's a clear indicator of immediate profit potential offering a direct glimpse into the potential success of your option trade conversely for put options intrinsic value exists when the stock price is below the strike price imagine holding a put option with a strike price of $50 while the stock trades at $45 here the intrinsic value is also $5 representing the profit you'd gain if the option were exercised immediately intrinsic value is essentially the built-in profit in your option position and it's a critical component in assessing an option's worth it's this built-in profit that often drives the initial appeal of an option trade when you understand intrinsic value you're not just looking at the numbers and predictions you're seeing the actual immediate worth of your options based on current market conditions a crucial step in developing your trading strategy let's talk about time value and the clock's impact on options time value in options trading is similar to the premium you pay for the potential future profitability of the option Beyond its current intrinsic value it's the extra amount you're willing to invest for the possibility that the options value will increase before expiration due to changes in the underlying stocks price this component of the options premium is a dynamic everchanging figure driven by the time remaining until the options expiration date the longer the time before an option expires the higher its time value this is because more time equates to a greater chance for the underlying stock to move in a favorable Direction it's like buying a lottery ticket well before the draw the anticipation and potential for winning grow as the draw date approaches on the flip side as expiration nears time value decreases a phenomenon known as time Decay this is crucial for Traders to understand as it highlights a fundamental risk in options trading the erosion of potential profit over time the rate of time Decay accelerates as the option expiration date looms closer particularly in the last few weeks this means that an option can lose value even if the underlying stock price remains static purely due to the passing of time for an option Trader this underlines the importance of timing the decision- making just as in chess where the value of a move depends not just on the Move itself but also on the timing of it in options trading the value of an option is intrinsically linked to when it is exercised or sold understanding and managing time value is thus a key strategy in maximizing returns from options trading time Decay is an essal essential Concept in options trading acting as a silent force that gradually diminishes the value of an option as it nears its expiration officially known as Theta time Decay represents the rate at which the value of an option decreases over time assuming all other factors remain constant it's a critical aspect because it highlights a fundamental truth about options they are time-sensitive instruments and their value is not just about the underlying stocks price movement but also about how much time is left for that movement to occur as day passes the option loses a bit of its premium akin to an ice cube slowly melting away this loss accelerates as the exploration date approaches making time Decay a more pronounced factor in the options value during the final days of its lifespan for option buyers this means being mindful of the ticking clock holding an option for too long can erode potential profits even if the stock moves in the desired direction for sellers of options time decay can be a friend it works in their favor as the options they've sold lose value over time potentially allowing them to buy back the options at a lower price or simply let them expire worthless capturing the full premium this Dynamic makes strategies like selling covered calls or writing puts potentially profitable particularly in sideways or slightly bullish market conditions however it's crucial to understand that while time Decay is a predictable and steady force it does not operate in a vacuum Market events shifts in volatility and movements in the underlying stocks price can all interplay with time decay affecting the value of an option hence successful options trading requires not just an understanding of time Decay but also an ability to navigate these other Market forces in conjunction with it one of my top strategies in options trading is selling options and it's the power of time Decay that empowers me to consistently generate earnings in the range of $6 to $8,000 weekly this strategy which I consider to be relatively lowrisk primarily involves selling covered calls or cash secured puts on stocks that I'm interested in owning it's a a method that not only aligns with my investment goals but also capitalizes on the gradual erosion of option value over time turning this into a profitable lowrisk stream it's a method that not only aligns with my investment goals but also capitalizes on the gradual erosion of option value over time turning this into a profitable low-risk income stream week after week for those looking to closely follow and learn from my trading strategies I offer detailed alerts and strategy breakdowns on my patreon this is an opportunity for anyone interested in real-time insights and practical applications in options trading to benefit from the same techniques that make money in any type of Market volatility and time value are the dynamic duo in options volatility plays a pivotal role in the world of options acting as a critical factor that can significantly impact an option's time value it's akin to the heartbeat of the market dictating the rhythm of price movements High volatility suggests larger price swings in the underlying stock which can amplify the potential for an option to move in a profitable position before the expiration this heightened uncertainty can inflate the time value as Traders are willing to pay a premium for the increased chance of larger gains it's like being on a high stakes game the more unpredictable the outcome the higher the potential reward options Traders must stay attuned to this volatility as it can drastically change the landscape of their investment offering both opportunities for higher gains and increased risk firstly in times of low volatility when stock prices are relative stable and predictable the time value of options tends to decrease this is because the likelihood of stock prices making significant moves diminishes reducing the chances of options expiring in the money in such scenarios the Market's calm waterers me options are priced more modestly reflecting the lower probability of dramatic price shifts however this doesn't necessarily spell a lack of opportunity for the astute Trader understanding how volatility interacts with time value can open avenues for strategic positioning such as op for the astute Trader understanding how volatility interacts with time value can open avenues for strategic positioning such as opting for selling strategies when volatility is low thereby capitalizing on the reduced time value mastering the interplay between volatility and time value is therefore a crucial skill allowing traders to navigate the E and flow of the options Market with greater confidence and foresight as we finish today's lesson it's clear that understanding option prices is fundamental to successful options Trad the premium a blend of intrinsic and time value isn't just a cost but a reflection of market dynamics investor expectations and strategic opportunities intrinsic value provides a snapshot of immediate profitability based on current stock prices while time value represents the potential for future gains influenced heavily by time Decay and Market volatility grasping these Concepts equips Traders with the ability to make informed decisions tailoring strategies to both current market conditions and anticipated future changes in essence a deep understanding of option pricing isn't just about numbers it's about interpreting Market signals assessing risks and seizing opportunities in the ever evolving world of stock

below and don't forget to like share and subscribe for more insid or tips on mastering the stock market until next time keep those Investments Savvy and your strategy sharp peace and I'll see you soon","This video provides a foundational understanding of options pricing, explaining that an option's premium is comprised of **intrinsic value** (its immediate, tangible worth for in-the-money options) and **extrinsic (time) value**. Extrinsic value is a speculative component influenced by **time remaining until expiration** and **market volatility**.

Key insights highlight that **time decay (Theta)** causes options to lose value as expiration nears (accelerating in final weeks), benefiting sellers. Conversely, **volatility** significantly impacts time value, with higher volatility generally increasing an option's price.

Speaker Jerry Romine's primary strategy is **selling options (covered calls or cash-secured puts)**, which he considers a ""low-risk"" method designed to capitalize on time decay, claiming to consistently generate $6,000-$8,000 in weekly income. He emphasizes that a deep understanding of these pricing components—intrinsic value, time value, time decay, and volatility—is essential for interpreting market signals, assessing risks, and seizing opportunities in options trading.",Weebl,0.9,0.8

focus on the essentials of options trading options are versatile tools that allow traders to profit in varying market conditions offering opportunities in both rising and falling markets as an option buyer you can gain from Market upswings while as an option Rider you benefit from Market stability or declines this adaptability distinguishes options trading from traditional stock trading where profits are generally dependent on buying at lower prices and selling at higher prices options trading is not just about Market Direction but also about leveraging Market volatility and timing making it a valuable strategy for diverse Market scenarios in the dynamic world of options trading understanding call andp put options is crucial call options offer you the buyer the right to purchase a stock at a predetermined price within a specified time frame they are a bet on the Stock's price Rising Above This set price before the option expires when you buy a call option your risk is limited to the premium paid and the potential for profit is significant if the stock price Soares it's like holding a ticket that gains value as the stock climbs offering a leverage that can multiply your investment on the flip side put options provide the right to sell a stock at a predetermined price they are your Safeguard in a declining Market turning a profit when stock prices fall below the strike price buying a put is like having an insurance policy for your portfolio where you benefit if the market dips put options serve as a powerful tool for hedging against Market downturns allowing traders to protect their Investments and even profit from Market volatility both call and putut options encapsulate the essence of options trading leveraging Market movements to your advantage whether they rise or fall market volatility is the LIF flood of options trading and understanding how to navigate it is key options are unique in that they can turn Market uncertainty often a source of anxiety for investors into a strategic advantage in volatile markets prices swing significantly this is where options truly shine as an options Trader you have the ability to profit from these fluctuations in a way that traditional stock trading doesn't allow for instance when the market is unpredictable option prices tend to increase due to higher demand creating opportunities for option sellers to earn higher premiums conversely in less volatile or sideways markets the movement of stock prices is minimal here option strategies can still be employed effectively option spreads for example can be used to generate profits from small price movements these strategies involve buying and selling multiple options simultaneously to capitalize on The Limited price action the beauty of options in such market conditions lies in their flexibility you can adjust your strategies to suit Market Behavior maximizing your potential for profit regardless of whether the market is jumping wildly or moving at a snail's pace buying call options is a strategy that bets on the rise of stock prices when you buy a call option you're essentially purchasing the right to buy a stock at a specified price known as the strike price within a predetermined time frame the beauty of this strategy lies in its leverage potential for a relatively small upfront investment the premium you gain control over a significant number of shares this leverage can amplify your profits if the stock price surges above the strike price before the option expires it's a strategy that thrives on bullish Market sentiment turning a relatively modest outlay into a potentially substantial gain if the market moves in your favor however this strategy isn't without risks the premium paid for the call option could be lost if the stock doesn't rise above the strike price for expiration this is the trade-off for the leverage provided by call options higher potential returns for higher risk of losing the premium paid it's crucial to assess the Stock's potential for growth and the time frame for such growth when considering this strategy the key to success in buying call options is not just predicting the direction of the stock price but also understanding the timing of Market movements put options on the other hand serve as a powerful tool for Traders looking to profit from declining stock prices when you buy a put option you're you're securing the right to sell a stock at a predetermined strike price this strategy is particularly advantageous in bearish markets or when a specific stock is expected to decline the essence of buying a put option is not just in betting against the stock but in leveraging downward Market movements for example if a stock is currently priced at $100 and you buy a put option with a strike price of $95 you're anticipating the stock to drop below this level if the stock Falls to say $90 your put option becomes more valuable allowing you to sell the stock at a higher price than the current market value this approach offers two key benefits first it provides a hedge against losses in your stock portfolio by owning put options you can offset the decline in your stock Holdings effectively insuring your Investments against Market downturns second it opens up opportunities for significant profits from minimal Investments the initial cost of a put option the premium can be relatively low compared to the potential gains if the stock price Falls sharply however similar to call options the risk lies in the possibility of the stock not dropping below the strike price before the expiration date leading to a loss of the premium paid this strategy demands a keen understanding of market trends and the ability to predict downward movements accurately writing options a strategy involving the sale of call or put options offers a different path to provide in the options Market when you write a call option you're selling someone else the right to buy a stock from you at a specific price within a set time frame this strategy is most beneficial when you believe the stock price will remain below the strike price allowing you to pocket the premium paid by the option buyer it's like renting out your stocks if the price doesn't go above the strike price you keep the premium or rent and your stocks covered call writing where you own the underlying stock is particularly popular as it provides a way to generate income on your stock Holdings with relatively low risk and I write a lot of covered calls writing put options involve selling the right to sell a stock at a predetermined price this strategy works best when you anticipate the stock price to remain above the strike price enabling you to earn the premium with minimal risk it's akin to betting on the stock stability or mild increase however the risks with riding options especially uncovered ones can be significant if the market moves against your prediction your potential losses can exceed the premiums received for instance in uncovered call writing which I really don't recommend for most people if the stock price Soares well above the strike price your losses can be substantial therefore this strategy requires a thorough understanding of market trends and risk management writing options can be a lucrative strategy but it demands careful analysis and a solid grasp of Market Dynamic every week I sell calls and puts which are some of my favorite strategies in options trading this approach consistently generates a weekly income of $6 to $8,000 and often more for those looking to closely follow and learn from my trading strategies I offer detailed alerts and strategy breakdowns on my patreon this is an opportunity for anyone interested in in real-time insights and practical applications and options trading to benefit from the same techniques that make money in any type of Market selecting the right options for trading hinges on a clear understanding of your Market views and objectives first consider whether you're bullish or bearish on the stock sector or the overall Market you're targeting your sentiment be it strongly moderately or slightly bullish or bearish guides your strategy choice for instance if you're highly bullish on a particular stock buying call options or writing put options might be the way to go inversely if you're bearish buying put options or writing call options could be more appropriate the second key aspect is volatility assess the current market volatility and the specific volatility of the stock or sector you're interested in for stocks in high volatility periods strategies like buying options might be favorable due to the potential for large price swings in contrast in low volatility scenarios writing options could be more lucrative given the lower likelihood of significant price movements additionally consider the strike price and expiration date of the options if you're expecting a quick move in the stock if you're expecting a quick move in the stock shorter term options might be more suitable conversely if you're planning for a longer term Trend longer dated options could be the better choice the art of successful options trading lies in aligning these factors your Market Outlook volatility assessment and the specifics of strike price and expiration to craft a strategy that suits your investment goals and risk tolerance when trading options the key to maximizing success lies in strategic selection and timing for option buyers prioritizing options with a longer expiration is often a wise move this approach provides more time for the market to move in your favor enhancing the likelihood of a profitable outcome however it's not just about duration the cost of the option is also crucial opting for cheaper options may seem counterintuitive but it can actually opting for cheaper options may seem counterintuitive but it can actually increase your chances of a successful trade these lower cost options typically have lower implied volatility suggesting lower odds of a big move yet if the market does swing favorably the potential payoff can be substantial conversely when writing options my strategy involves selecting contracts with the shortest possible expiration typically between 1 to two weeks this method effectively limits my exposure time minimizing the risk of the market moving unfavorably during the option period this approach is a strategic balance of risk and return demanding an acute understanding of market dynamics and a depth timing my focus extends across various sectors always considering the potential volatility and movement patterns that could affect the outcome of the options later in this course I will dive into the finer details of how I select and manage these short duration trades highlighting the key tactics that drive their success successful options trading hinges not just on the choice of strategy but also on how well it is

trading series peace and I'll see you","This YouTube video, Lesson 3 of an options trading series, emphasizes options as versatile financial instruments enabling traders to profit across all market conditions—rising, falling, volatile, or sideways—by strategically leveraging market volatility and timing.

**Key Investment Strategies and Recommendations:**

*   **Option Buying:**
    *   **Call Options** are recommended for bullish outlooks, offering leveraged profit potential if the stock price rises above the strike, with risk limited to the premium paid.
    *   **Put Options** are advised for bearish views or as a hedging tool, allowing profits from declining prices and serving as portfolio ""insurance.""
    *   Buyers should prioritize options with **longer expirations** for more time and consider ""cheaper options"" for potentially significant payoffs if the market moves favorably.
*   **Option Writing (Selling):** This strategy focuses on generating income by collecting premiums.
    *   **Writing Call Options** is beneficial when anticipating the stock price to remain below the strike. **Covered calls** (owning the underlying stock) are highlighted as a popular, lower-risk income strategy, while **uncovered calls** are strongly cautioned against due to substantial loss potential.
    *   **Writing Put Options** is advantageous when expecting the stock price to remain above the strike, earning premium with minimal risk.
    *   Writers, including the presenter, typically select contracts with the **shortest possible expiration** (1-2 weeks) to limit exposure and risk.

**Speaker's Personal Strategy & General Principles:**

The presenter reportedly sells calls and puts weekly, generating a consistent income of $6,000-$8,000 or more, offering detailed alerts on Patreon. The video stresses that effective options trading requires **adaptability**, aligning strategies with specific market views (bullish/bearish), current market volatility (buying in high volatility, writing in low/sideways markets), and appropriate strike/expiration dates, as there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. Ultimately, options uniquely turn market uncertainty into a strategic advantage, but success hinges on a robust understanding of market trends, disciplined risk assessment, and consistent execution.",Weebl,0.9,0.8

buyer you can gain from Market upswings while as an option Rider you benefit from Market stability or declines this adaptability distinguishes options trading from traditional stock trading where profits are generally dependent on buying at lower prices and selling at higher prices options trading is not just about Market Direction but also about leveraging Market volatility and timing making it a valuable strategy for diverse Market scenarios in the dynamic world of options trading understanding call andp put options is crucial call options offer you the buyer the right to purchase a stock at a predetermined price within a specified time frame they are a bet on the Stock's price Rising Above This set price before the option expires when you buy a call option your risk is limited to the premium paid and the potential for profit is significant if the stock price Soares it's like holding a ticket that gains value as the stock climbs offering a leverage that can multiply your investment on the flip side put options provide the right to sell a stock at a predetermined price they are your Safeguard in a declining Market turning a profit when stock prices fall below the strike price buying a put is like having an insurance policy for your portfolio where you benefit if the market dips put options serve as a powerful tool for hedging against Market downturns allowing traders to protect their Investments and even profit from Market volatility both call and putut options encapsulate the essence of options trading leveraging Market movements to your advantage whether they rise or fall market volatility is the LIF flood of options trading and understanding how to navigate it is key options are unique in that they can turn Market uncertainty often a source of anxiety for investors into a strategic advantage in volatile markets prices swing significantly this is where options truly shine as an options Trader you have the ability to profit from these fluctuations in a way that traditional stock trading doesn't allow for instance when the market is unpredictable option prices tend to increase due to higher demand creating opportunities for option sellers to earn higher premiums conversely in less volatile or sideways markets the movement of stock prices is minimal here option strategies can still be employed effectively option spreads for example can be used to generate profits from small price movements these strategies involve buying and selling multiple options simultaneously to capitalize on The Limited price action the beauty of options in such market conditions lies in their flexibility you can adjust your strategies to suit Market Behavior maximizing your potential for profit regardless of whether the market is jumping wildly or moving at a snail's pace buying call options is a strategy that bets on the rise of stock prices when you buy a call option you're essentially purchasing the right to buy a stock at a specified price known as the strike price within a predetermined time frame the beauty of this strategy lies in its leverage potential for a relatively small upfront investment the premium you gain control over a significant number of shares this leverage can amplify your profits if the stock price surges above the strike price before the option expires it's a strategy that thrives on bullish Market sentiment turning a relatively modest outlay into a potentially substantial gain if the market moves in your favor however this strategy isn't without risks the premium paid for the call option could be lost if the stock doesn't rise above the strike price for expiration this is the trade-off for the leverage provided by call options higher potential returns for higher risk of losing the premium paid it's crucial to assess the Stock's potential for growth and the time frame for such growth when considering this strategy the key to success in buying call options is not just predicting the direction of the stock price but also understanding the timing of Market movements put options on the other hand serve as a powerful tool for Traders looking to profit from declining stock prices when you buy a put option you're you're securing the right to sell a stock at a predetermined strike price this strategy is particularly advantageous in bearish markets or when a specific stock is expected to decline the essence of buying a put option is not just in betting against the stock but in leveraging downward Market movements for example if a stock is currently priced at $100 and you buy a put option with a strike price of $95 you're anticipating the stock to drop below this level if the stock Falls to say $90 your put option becomes more valuable allowing you to sell the stock at a higher price than the current market value this approach offers two key benefits first it provides a hedge against losses in your stock portfolio by owning put options you can offset the decline in your stock Holdings effectively insuring your Investments against Market downturns second it opens up opportunities for significant profits from minimal Investments the initial cost of a put option the premium can be relatively low compared to the potential gains if the stock price Falls sharply however similar to call options the risk lies in the possibility of the stock not dropping below the strike price before the expiration date leading to a loss of the premium paid this strategy demands a keen understanding of market trends and the ability to predict downward movements accurately writing options a strategy involving the sale of call or put options offers a different path to provide in the options Market when you write a call option you're selling someone else the right to buy a stock from you at a specific price within a set time frame this strategy is most beneficial when you believe the stock price will remain below the strike price allowing you to pocket the premium paid by the option buyer it's like renting out your stocks if the price doesn't go above the strike price you keep the premium or rent and your stocks covered call writing where you own the underlying stock is particularly popular as it provides a way to generate income on your stock Holdings with relatively low risk and I write a lot of covered calls writing put options involve selling the right to sell a stock at a predetermined price this strategy works best when you anticipate the stock price to remain above the strike price enabling you to earn the premium with minimal risk it's akin to betting on the stock stability or mild increase however the risks with riding options especially uncovered ones can be significant if the market moves against your prediction your potential losses can exceed the premiums received for instance in uncovered call writing which I really don't recommend for most people if the stock price Soares well above the strike price your losses can be substantial therefore this strategy requires a thorough understanding of market trends and risk management writing options can be a lucrative strategy but it demands careful analysis and a solid grasp of Market Dynamic every week I sell calls and puts which are some of my favorite strategies in options trading this approach consistently generates a weekly income of $6 to $8,000 and often more for those

in for stocks in high volatility periods strategies like buying options might be favorable due to the potential for large price swings in contrast in low volatility scenarios writing options could be more lucrative given the lower likelihood of significant price movements additionally consider the strike price and expiration date of the options if you're expecting a quick move in the stock if you're expecting a quick move in the stock shorter term options might be more suitable conversely if you're planning for a longer term Trend longer dated options could be the better choice the art of successful options trading lies in aligning these factors your Market Outlook volatility assessment and the specifics of strike price and expiration to craft a strategy that suits your investment

**Key Investment Strategies and Recommendations:**

*   **Option Buying:**
    *   **Call Options** are recommended for bullish outlooks, offering leveraged profit potential if the stock price rises above the strike, with risk limited to the premium paid.
    *   **Put Options** are advised for bearish views or as a hedging tool, allowing profits from declining prices and serving as portfolio ""insurance.""
    *   Buyers should prioritize options with **longer expirations** for more time and consider ""cheaper options"" for potentially significant payoffs if the market moves favorably.
*   **Option Writing (Selling):** This strategy focuses on generating income by collecting premiums.
    *   **Writing Call Options** is beneficial when anticipating the stock price to remain below the strike. **Covered calls** (owning the underlying stock) are highlighted as a popular, lower-risk income strategy, while **uncovered calls** are strongly cautioned against due to substantial loss potential.
    *   **Writing Put Options** is advantageous when expecting the stock price to remain above the strike, earning premium with minimal risk.
    *   Writers, including the presenter, typically select contracts with the **shortest possible expiration** (1-2 weeks) to limit exposure and risk.

**Speaker's Personal Strategy & General Principles:**

The presenter reportedly sells calls and puts weekly, generating a consistent income of $6,000-$8,000 or more, offering detailed alerts on Patreon. The video stresses that effective options trading requires **adaptability**, aligning strategies with specific market views (bullish/bearish), current market volatility (buying in high volatility, writing in low/sideways markets), and appropriate strike/expiration dates, as there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. Ultimately, options uniquely turn market uncertainty into a strategic advantage, but success hinges on a robust understanding of market trends, disciplined risk assessment, and consistent execution.",Mumu,0.9,0.8
