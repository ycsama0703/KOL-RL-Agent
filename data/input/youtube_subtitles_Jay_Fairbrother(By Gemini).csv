some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Vanguard,0.9,0.7

interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Invesco,0.9,0.8

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac

that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Apple,1.0,0.9

14:54 Bonus ETF!","Kind: captions Language: en the best thing about investing is there's an infinite number of ways to invest your money and grow your wealth and if you're someone who wants to pour some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Microsoft,1.0,0.9

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Amazon,1.0,0.9

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Tesla,1.0,0.9

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take

index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Costco,1.0,0.8

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index

also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in

those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco

14:54 Bonus ETF!","Kind: captions Language: en the best thing about investing is there's an infinite number of ways to invest your money and grow your wealth and if you're someone who wants to pour some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",William Sonoma,0.9,0.8

AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Corning,0.9,0.8

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the

has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",vanac,0.9,0.9

14:54 Bonus ETF!","Kind: captions Language: en the best thing about investing is there's an infinite number of ways to invest your money and grow your wealth and if you're someone who wants to pour some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as

today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",AMD,1.0,1.0

2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.
3.  **XMHQ (Invesco Mid-Cap Quality ETF):** Offers genuine diversification with no S&P 500 overlap, focusing on mid-cap ""quality"" stocks selected by factors like return on equity. It outperformed the S&P 500 by 87% over five years but has recently lagged, potentially due to sensitivity to interest rate environments. It carries the highest expense ratio at 0.25%.
4.  **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF):** Represents a high-risk, high-reward play with extreme outperformance (150% over five years, 133% over one year) due to its specialized focus on the semiconductor industry (e.g., Nvidia, Broadcom). Its single-industry concentration makes it highly vulnerable to sector-specific downturns. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.

Overall, while these growth ETFs offer potential for significant returns, investors must weigh the risks associated with sector concentration, overlap with existing portfolios, and strategy-specific volatilities. The speaker also teases a personally held ""bonus ETF"" that purportedly beats the S&P 500 long-term with minimal overlap, to be revealed later.",Intel,1.0,1.0

some gas on the fire and really accelerate your investment returns this year this video is for you by the end of this video I'll give you four of the absolute best growth ETFs that you can use to both accelerate your gains and diversify your portfolio including one that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 150% and the best part is you likely have haven't heard of most of these ETFs before right now if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can grow your wealth and achieve your goals of Financial Freedom and today that means talking about growth ETFs Now growth ETFs sole purpose are to invest in companies that are likely to grow faster than the market as a whole which make them a great addition to your Investment Portfolio if you don't mind taking on a little extra risk for potentially massive returns and by investing in a growth ETF you're still getting a diversified investment that'll manage your risk much better than if you tried to handpick individual companies on your own each one of the ETFs I'm going to show you today invests in different ways so I'll give you everything you need to know about each one so you can decide which ones interest you the most and do your further research from there our first growth ETF today is one that gets overshadowed by more popular options like vug the Vanguard growth Index Fund or QQQ the Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund but this ETF has outperformed both of those and most other growth ETFs over the past few years and it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 62% over the last 5 years it's ticker symbol scg the Schwab us large cap growth ETF and it's returned nearly 38% over the past 1 year and nearly 146 % gains Over The Last 5 Years the sgf invests in stocks that are included in the Dow Jones US large cap stock market index it's a diversified ETF as it holds 229 different stocks and the secret to its amazing performance becomes clear once we take a closer look atg's Holdings because a whopping 47.8% of scg's Holdings come from the technology sector which I'm sure we're all aware of is where all of the explosive growth in the stock market has happened over the past several years and this is reflected ing's top 10 Holdings which read like a list of the best performing stocks over the past 5 to 10 years Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta Tesla they're all here the best part about scg however is that it delivers all of those explosive gains and growth for a minuscule cost the expense ratio on this ETF is 0.04 % that means it'll cost you $4 per year for every $11,000 you invest that is about as low as you can find and it's right on par with some of my favorite index funds like vo and vti from Vanguard but there is some risk that comes along with investing Ing and that comes in two forms the first we just kind of touched on because scg is so heavily weighted towards the tech sector of the stock market if that sector sees things slow down at all or if another area of the stock market heats up and becomes the one that delivers a lot of growth going forward you could find scg start to underperform ETFs or the S&amp;P 500 as a whole if its Holdings don't shift quite in line with that shifting performance in the stock market secondly most of us have our investment portfolios built on a base layer of broad index funds like the S&amp;P 500 stock market index fund or the total us stock market index fund and because scg is a large cap growth ETF that means by holding it in addition to an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund we're really doubling down on those large Mega cap growth stocks look at the top Holdings of scg once again they're all household names they're all the largest stocks in the stock market which also means they're the largest Holdings of our S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index funds as well we can see how this plays out when we compare the Holdings of scg to vo the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 in X fund 120 Holdings overlap between these two ETFs that means if you plan on holding scg in conjunction with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund you have to be okay with doubling down on your concentration on those 120 Holdings but if you're looking for a growth ETF and you don't want to be so heavily invested in the tech sector the next ETF on our list may be one for you it's returned just under 50% over the past year and 170% Over The Last 5 Years once again crushing the S&amp;P 500 over those time frames and it's done it while only being 22% weighted towards the technology sector this ETF is instead a bit more evenly distributed with 24% of its Holdings being in financial services 22% in Tech 13% in consumer staples and just over 10% in the industrial sector this ET is ticker spmo the Invesco S&amp;P 500 momentum ETF and this ETF holds 100 stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index that it determines have the highest momentum score how they do this in their own words is by evaluating the percentage change in stock price over the last 12 months of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index then and I quote applying an adjustment based on the Security's volatility over that period so no exact details on that calculation but again in their own words looking for stocks that quote exhibit persistence in its relative performance so basically what they're doing is they came up with a calculation to find stocks that have been outperforming over the past 12 months and look to continue outperforming over the near future and while this overall ETF isn't as heavily weighted towards the tech sector as we saw with scg the top Holdings do bring back some familiar names Amazon Nvidia broadcom and meta are the top four Holdings of this ETF but after that the rest of the top 10 gets significantly less techy with names like birkshire hathway Costco and Walmart making an appearance spmo does come with a slightly higher expense ratio coming in at 0.13% meaning you'll pay $13 per year for every $1,000 you have invested in the spmo ETF that's slightly higher than most index funds you'll find out there but it's still very low and a completely acceptable expense ratio for the performance that this ETF has shown the risks of spmo are again fund overlap this time to an even greater degree as 100% of the Holdings of spmo are contained in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund now that might be fairly obvious as it's starting with the S&amp;P 500 as its base of stocks picking from I'm also slightly wary of relying on quote unquote momentum if there's any anything being a sports fan has taught me it's that momentum changes quickly one minute your team is taking the lead and is 13 seconds away from the Super Bowl and the next you're sitting in stunn silence on your couch feeling like you just got kicked in the gut anyway my point here is that momentum can change at a moment's notice and if their algorithm or calculation can't predict that momentum shift quickly enough or accurately enough as pmo holders may find themselves underperforming the market they set up to beat before we get too much further in this list I should blindly chasing performance and investing in something because it's put up big numbers over the past few years is the wrong way to invest in these or any other Investments you may choose before you put money into anything make sure it fits your goals for your money and your overall investing strategy and stick with me towards the end of this video to see which ETF I am personally heavily invested in to add a boost of growth and performance to my Investment Portfolio because if you're like me you've built the foundation of your portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund or a total stock market index fund and those problems of fund overlap with scg and spmo might make them less attractive options because of how they'd affect the balance of your overall portfolio our next growth ETF doesn't have any of these fund overlap issues because it's a midcap growth fund most of the Holdings in our first two ETFs were in large or Mega cap stocks companies with over $200 billion in market cap midcap stocks are smaller they're sized between $6.7 billion and $18 billion in market cap size which is how xmq the Invesco midcap quality ETF avoids all of those overlap problems with the S&amp;P 500 Index these stocks simply aren't large enough to qualify for the S&amp;P 500 xmq chooses the stocks it holds by scoring the stocks in the S&amp;P midcap 400 index on a quality score based on factors such as return on equity acrs ratio and the financial leverage ratio and then buying the highest scoring 80 stocks after that calculation is done again in simple terms the ETF is looking for any midsized companies that generate higher revenue and more cash flow than their peers while being financially prudent as a company in doing so so the companies included in the xhq ETF should be the top performing midsize companies out there that don't mismanage their cash or take on loads of debt in order to get that performance xhq is weighted 34% towards the industrial sector and there are a few familiar names amongst its top 10 Holdings such as William Sonoma owns Corning and Toll Brothers Builders XM HQ has had a bit of a rough go over the past one year returning 14% but it does outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Over The Last 5 Years returning over 87% in that period the real value to xhq though is that this is the first ETF on the list that you can use to really and truly diversify your Investment Portfolio like we mentioned not a single stock in xhq is held in your S&amp;P 500 Index Fund so aside from providing extra growth opportunities xmq might be a good option to look at to consider diversifying your portfolio away from being so heavily weighted in those massive companies that dominate the S&amp;P 500 xmq does have the highest expense ratio we've seen on this list so far coming in at a quarter of a percent so you'll be paying $25 per year for every $1,000 you invest in this ETF a bit higher than the market average of 0.12% for a passively managed ETF but well within what I would deem acceptable when considering an ETF for my own Investments and the main risk of X amhq is that well yes it has outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years it is down on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 1 year and with so much of the stock market's overall growth being driven just by a small number of those Mega huge large companies over the past couple of years holding xhq risks underperforming the market until that Trend shifts and historically there are shifts in performance between large cap midcap and small cap stocks and we don't know how when or why these shifts in performance will take place which is one of the keys that diversifying is such an important part of any invest investment strategy I will say however that small cap and midcap stocks tend to perform better in low interest rate environments and with the FED continuing to cut interest rates into the foreseeable future now I wouldn't count out xmq from overperforming over the next 12 months and don't shake your head at the next ETF on this list because it's beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 133% over the past year and by over 150% over the past 5 years that's right this ETF has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 150% Over The Last 5 Years the ETF is ticker SMH the vanac semiconductor ETF often times finding growth that will trounce the stock market in general means you have to find a specific industry of growth and make a big Bet On It the SMH ETF does just that it holds only 26 stocks and as you can guess the all come from the technology sector however the names aren't the same ones we've seen on other ETFs in this list there's no apples or microsofts here the SMH ETF zero in on the semiconductor industry which has been absolutely RedHot over the past number of years and honestly doesn't look to be slowing down with the explosive growth we're seeing in the AI sector and language learning models and that's why the top 10 Holdings are all names you probably recognize from that sector Nvidia broadcom Qualcomm AMD Intel and so on the expense ratio of SMH comes in at 0.35% meaning each year you'll pay $35 for every 1,000 you have invested in the ETF which is a long way from the 0.04% we saw with scg but when you get into these very specialized ETFs you're generally going to find higher expense ratios on them then honestly it's below half a percent so it's nothing that I would let scare me off if I was interested in investing in this ETF 20 of the 26 Holdings in the SMH ETF do overlap with the S&amp;P 500 Index but honestly if you're investing in an ETF like this you just don't need to care about that the whole point of holding this ETF is to gain is to gain more exposure to a single industry that by all accounts should continue to deliver amazing growth in the foreseeable future with that said the risks of SMH are simple you're investing in a single industry if anything should happen to cause a Slowdown in the semiconductor industry say tariffs on the product or materials supply chain interruptions material shortages anything like that and you're really going to feel the effects on your SMH investment it's a high-risk High reward play on a single industry and should be treated as such if you're considering it for investment now the one ETF I haven't talked about so far is the one that I'm personally investing in as a way to boost my overall investment returns it's an investment that has beaten the S&amp;P 500 not over one year but over every 20 and 30e period in history and it avoids nearly all overlap issues we've seen in many of the ETFs we've looked at in this video and I show you exactly what that ETF is and why I decided to make it a key portion of my investment Holdings in this video right here so thanks for watching this video I really hope you found it interesting and I hope to see you in the next one","Growth ETFs are introduced as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for accelerating returns and diversifying portfolios, emphasizing the critical need for due diligence over chasing past performance.

The analysis details four specific growth ETFs:

1.  **SCG (Schwab US Large Cap Growth ETF):** Outperformed the S&P 500 by 62% over five years, largely due to a 47.8% allocation to mega-cap tech like Apple and Nvidia. Its low 0.04% expense ratio is attractive, but risks include significant tech concentration and substantial overlap with broad S&P 500 funds, effectively doubling down on existing large-cap growth exposure.
2.  **SPMO (Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF):** Crushed the S&P 500 with a 170% return over five years by selecting 100 S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum scores. While more sector-distributed, its primary risks are the inherent volatility of momentum-driven strategies and complete overlap with S&P 500 holdings. It has a 0.13% expense ratio.

#shortterminvestment #savings #personalfinance",Kind: captions Language: en over the next few minutes I'm going to show you the absolute best places to hold your cash in 2025 that will have you earning the most interest on your money and keep you free from worrying about rapidly changing interest rates if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so you can remove the financial worry and stress from your life and move on to thriving financially and while that might not be the most exciting thing to talk about how much cash you hold and where you hold it is one of the most important steps in securing your financial future so let's take a look at some of the best short-term Investments for 2025 so you can determine which of these is the best spot to park your cash in but first we have to start with a few places you should absolutely not be holding your excess money and that's in your checking account a savings account with a traditional bank or God forbid physical cash I mean does anyone even use physical cash anymore I feel like anytime I'm giv paper money or just have it around it's more of an annoyance than anything else but you should not be holding any excess cash in your checking account other than what you need to cover your day-to-day spending and bills checking accounts pay little to no interest and are meant as a transactional account not a place to hold your money and try to grow your wealth unfortunately the same can be said for most savings accounts at traditional Banks they earn extreme extremely subpar interest rates a Chase Premier savings account currently only pays 0.02% interest with a $25 monthly fee on the account so instead of a traditional savings account the first option you want to look at for holding your cash is a high yield savings account most of you are likely familiar with a high yield savings account but here are a few quick pros and cons to keep in mind as we compare it to some of the other options we'll be discussing later on in the video so to start with the pros a high yield savings account is likely going to be the most liquid option you have available meaning your money is available immediately and it can be transferred to any of your other accounts extremely quickly and unlik traditional savings accounts high yield savings accounts are just that high yield my savings account at M1 Finance currently pays just under 5% interest far better than the fractions of a percent at beginning at a traditional bank and because a high yield savings account is still just a bank account you can set up direct deposit into it out of every paycheck you earn to automate your savings and keep it growing handsfree and there are also a few cons to high yield savings accounts that we'll want to keep in mind as we compare these different investment choices the interest rate on a high yield savings account will always change when the FED announces their interest rates meaning every time you read on the news of an interest rate increase or decrease you can expect the interest rate on your high yield savings account to increase or decrease that exact amount usually within a day or two and high yield savings account aren't the most tax efficient place to hold a lot of money especially in comparison to some of the other options we'll talk about any interest you earn on your high yeld savings account will be subject to any federal state or local income taxes you may be subject to depending on where you live so moving on from high yield savings accounts our next choice is another old school banking product and it's still does have its place that is the CD CD stands for certificate of deposit and it's an invest ment where you're agreeing to lock up your money for a set amount of time anywhere from a few months to a few years in exchange for a set interest rate over that period of time naturally the longer you agree to lock up your money in a CD the higher interest rate you'll earn and there are a few advantages to CDs right now most people expect interest rates to keep falling over the course of the next year so by putting your money into a CD right now you have the opportunity to lock in what will likely be a much higher interest rate than and you'll be able to earn on your cash in maybe just even a few months from now and if you want to hedge your bets on what interest rates are going to do with CDs you can ladder your CDs which I explain more in depth in a video I will link down in the description the disadvantage of the CDs are first and foremost your money is locked up for the duration of the CD that you buy so they're not the most liquid investment around and just like the high yield savings account any interest you earn on a CD is taxed as income at both the federal and state level in just a moment I'm going to talk about an option for your cash that I have never discussed on this channel before but first we need to revisit an old friend and any of you who have been with me on this channel for a while are surely aware of ibonds by this point if you need a refresher there are several videos on my channel that you can go check out to learn everything you need to know and more about ibond and the pros to ibond at least as I record this is that you're going to be able to lock in an interest rate that will outperform any other investment in this video for up to the next 30 Years and to explain how that works and maybe refresh your memory any interest in ibon Pays is comprised of two components there's a variable component which changes based on the inflation rate every 6 months and there is a fixed component which is held steady for the life of your ibond and because we're coming out of a high inflation and high interest rate era ibonds are still paying 1.2% as that fixed portion of their interest rate makeup that means you'll have a 1.2% boost on interest you're earning from your ibon likely over any of these other options I mentioned in this video for the entire time you choose to hold that ibond and ibonds are the first things I've mentioned today that also come with any sort of tax advantages they're not subject to any state or any local income taxes the cons to ibonds are that you can't touch that money even if you want to for a minimum of one year and if you cash them out between holding them one year and 5 years you'll have to Forfeit 3 months worth of interest earned as a penalty it's for those reasons and because you'll really only start to see the benefit of that fixed interest rate component that I would only consider ibonds as part of your conservative long-term Holdings the next option for our short-term savings is something I have never mentioned before on this channel and it's an option that is really growing in popularity for people who want to earn the most they possibly can on their short-term savings and that is a treasury ETF such as ticker sgv esgv how it works is relatively straightforward esgv is an ETF that you can buy and sell just like any other ETF on the market except that instead of the ETF holding a bunch of stocks an ETF like esgv invest completely into short-term us treasuries anything with a duration from 0 to 3 months when we're talking about ESO specifically esgv accumulates all the interest earned from those t- bills over the course of the month and then pays that out to the ETF holders as a monthly dividend more on that in a second if you look at the price chart of Esco it looks pretty weird kind of like a bunch of sharks teeth here's why the increases in price of Esco that you're seeing on the chart are simply the fun accumulating interest from T bills on a daily basis that drives the price up depending on how much cash the fund is taking in and then when all that interest is paid out as a dividend it for lack of a better word resets the price back to the Baseline how much the price increased increases is simply a factor of interest rates as esgv will accumulate more interest and Rise that price higher when interest rates are high compared to when they're alone so the pros to holding a short-term treasury ETF like esgv is that it's extremely price stable you're not risking loss on your investment like you would with a stock ETF like even an S&amp;P 500 ETF it's liquid you can sell your shares and get your money out at any time and you'll get all the interest benefits of t- bills which usually beat a high yield savings account without any of the work of having to buy them individually and there are some cons to an ETF like esub as well first as with any ETF there is a management fee an expense ratio in the case of esgv is 0.09% which is about as close to zero as you can find but that still is 0.09% higher than any other option we've discussed so far and because esgv is an ETF you might want to think twice about using it for your short-term saving especially if you plan on dipping into it frequently because it can create a much more complicated tax filing compared to any of the other short-term Investments we have on this list selling shares and getting some cash out will probably result in there's some capital gains you have to deal with and I mentioned dividends earlier well eso's dividends aren't true qualified dividends like you'd get from a stock or a stock ETF esub is just passing all that t- bill interest back on to you so it'll be taxed as normal interest not the lower qualified dividend rate even though it is coming from an ETF also because it's an ETF it holds small amounts of nonte Bill things and you're not directly buying and holding the t- bills so it's not completely exempt from state and local taxes like t- bills and ibonds are instead earnings from Esco are only 96.45% exempt from those state and local income taxes like the expense ratio a very small amount that likely won't matter much at all but still something you should probably be aware of before inves so instead of Esco instead of an ETF maybe you just want to consider investing in t bills directly as we've established t- bills are short-term government bonds they have durations of anywhere from 1 month to one year and as we just mentioned are not subject to any state or local income taxes which is a real nice benefit if you live in a state that has state income taxes trust me you can buy t- bills either through most stock brokerages or through treasurydirect.gov which is where I personally do all my buying and holding of my t- bills and t- bills have great liquidity they won't tie your money up for long because of those short durations we just mentioned and if you really need to you can sell them before they mature although I recommend not doing that unless you really absolutely have to T bills generally have a slightly higher interest rate than you find on high yield savings accounts although that rate will change more frequently as the interest rate on T bills is determined by an auctioning process that happens every time new t- bills are issued to Market and the downsides to t- bills are that you're more exposed to changing interest rates than you would be on longer term bonds or CDs or even ibonds so before you decide to put your money into T bills or any of the other options we've discussed so far today you have to weigh your option between having your money as liquid and as available as possible or locked up for a slightly longer period of time but earning more interest on it and with T bills you can get the best of both of those Worlds by building a t- bill ladder it's how I personally invest in t- bills and I explain exactly how to do it in this video right here so thank you for watching this video go watch that one next and I'll see you there,"The video ""The Best Short-Term Investments For 2025"" guides viewers on maximizing interest on cash holdings while minimizing risk. It advises against low-yield options like checking or traditional savings accounts, recommending instead:

1.  **High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs):** Highly liquid, offer significantly higher (e.g., ~5%) but variable interest rates that fluctuate with Federal Reserve changes, and are fully taxable.
2.  **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** Allow locking in a fixed interest rate, beneficial when rates are expected to fall. Funds are less liquid (though laddering helps), and interest is fully taxed.
3.  **I-Bonds (Series I Savings Bonds):** Provide a combination of fixed and inflation-adjusted rates, are exempt from state and local income taxes, but require a minimum one-year hold and have early withdrawal penalties, making them suitable for conservative long-term cash.
4.  **Treasury ETFs (e.g., SGOV):** Invest in short-term U.S. treasuries, offering extreme price stability and liquidity. They are mostly exempt from state/local taxes but incur small management fees and have slightly more complex tax filing.
5.  **Direct T-Bills (Treasury Bills):** Offer very high liquidity (short durations), are completely exempt from state and local income taxes, and can be laddered for a balance of access and higher interest.

The speaker concludes that the optimal choice depends on an individual's specific liquidity needs, desired interest returns, and tax efficiency goals.",Chase,1.0,-0.9

#shortterminvestment #savings #personalfinance",Kind: captions Language: en over the next few minutes I'm going to show you the absolute best places to hold your cash in 2025 that will have you earning the most interest on your money and keep you free from worrying about rapidly changing interest rates if you're new here my name is Jay and from here on out I will be your personal guide to mastering your money so you can remove the financial worry and stress from your life and move on to thriving financially and while that might not be the most exciting thing to talk about how much cash you hold and where you hold it is one of the most important steps in securing your financial future so let's take a look at some of the best short-term Investments for 2025 so you can determine which of these is the best spot to park your cash in but first we have to start with a few places you should absolutely not be holding your excess money and that's in your checking account a savings account with a traditional bank or God forbid physical cash I mean does anyone even use physical cash anymore I feel like anytime I'm giv paper money or just have it around it's more of an annoyance than anything else but you should not be holding any excess cash in your checking account other than what you need to cover your day-to-day spending and bills checking accounts pay little to no interest and are meant as a transactional account not a place to hold your money and try to grow your wealth unfortunately the same can be said for most savings accounts at traditional Banks they earn extreme extremely subpar interest rates a Chase Premier savings account currently only pays 0.02% interest with a $25 monthly fee on the account so instead of a traditional savings account the first option you want to look at for holding your cash is a high yield savings account most of you are likely familiar with a high yield savings account but here are a few quick pros and cons to keep in mind as we compare it to some of the other options we'll be discussing later on in the video so to start with the pros a high yield savings account is likely going to be the most liquid option you have available meaning your money is available immediately and it can be transferred to any of your other accounts extremely quickly and unlik traditional savings accounts high yield savings accounts are just that high yield my savings account at M1 Finance currently pays just under 5% interest far better than the fractions of a percent at beginning at a traditional bank and because a high yield savings account is still just a bank account you can set up direct deposit into it out of every paycheck you earn to automate your savings and keep it growing handsfree and there are also a few cons to high yield savings accounts that we'll want to keep in mind as we compare these different investment choices the interest rate on a high yield savings account will always change when the FED announces their interest rates meaning every time you read on the news of an interest rate increase or decrease you can expect the interest rate on your high yield savings account to increase or decrease that exact amount usually within a day or two and high yield savings account aren't the most tax efficient place to hold a lot of money especially in comparison to some of the other options we'll talk about any interest you earn on your high yeld savings account will be subject to any federal state or local income taxes you may be subject to depending on where you live so moving on from high yield savings accounts our next choice is another old school banking product and it's still does have its place that is the CD CD stands for certificate of deposit and it's an invest ment where you're agreeing to lock up your money for a set amount of time anywhere from a few months to a few years in exchange for a set interest rate over that period of time naturally the longer you agree to lock up your money in a CD the higher interest rate you'll earn and there are a few advantages to CDs right now most people expect interest rates to keep falling over the course of the next year so by putting your money into a CD right now you have the opportunity to lock in what will likely be a much higher interest rate than and you'll be able to earn on your cash in maybe just even a few months from now and if you want to hedge your bets on what interest rates are going to do with CDs you can ladder your CDs which I explain more in depth in a video I will link down in the description the disadvantage of the CDs are first and foremost your money is locked up for the duration of the CD that you buy so they're not the most liquid investment around and just like the high yield savings account any interest you earn on a CD is taxed as income at both the federal and state level in just a moment I'm going to talk about an option for your cash that I have never discussed on this channel before but first we need to revisit an old friend and any of you who have been with me on this channel for a while are surely aware of ibonds by this point if you need a refresher there are several videos on my channel that you can go check out to learn everything you need to know and more about ibond and the pros to ibond at least as I record this is that you're going to be able to lock in an interest rate that will outperform any other investment in this video for up to the next 30 Years and to explain how that works and maybe refresh your memory any interest in ibon Pays is comprised of two components there's a variable component which changes based on the inflation rate every 6 months and there is a fixed component which is held steady for the life of your ibond and because we're coming out of a high inflation and high interest rate era ibonds are still paying 1.2% as that fixed portion of their interest rate makeup that means you'll have a 1.2% boost on interest you're earning from your ibon likely over any of these other options I mentioned in this video for the entire time you choose to hold that ibond and ibonds are the first things I've mentioned today that also come with any sort of tax advantages they're not subject to any state or any local income taxes the cons to ibonds are that you can't touch that money even if you want to for a minimum of one year and if you cash them out between holding them one year and 5 years you'll have to Forfeit 3 months worth of interest earned as a penalty it's for those reasons and because you'll really only start to see the benefit of that fixed interest rate component that I would only consider ibonds as part of your conservative long-term Holdings the next option for our short-term savings is something I have never mentioned before on this channel and it's an option that is really growing in popularity for people who want to earn the most they possibly can on their short-term savings and that is a treasury ETF such as ticker sgv esgv how it works is relatively straightforward esgv is an ETF that you can buy and sell just like any other ETF on the market except that instead of the ETF holding a bunch of stocks an ETF like esgv invest completely into short-term us treasuries anything with a duration from 0 to 3 months when we're talking about ESO specifically esgv accumulates all the interest earned from those t- bills over the course of the month and then pays that out to the ETF holders as a monthly dividend more on that in a second if you look at the price chart of Esco it looks pretty weird kind of like a bunch of sharks teeth here's why the increases in price of Esco that you're seeing on the chart are simply the fun accumulating interest from T bills on a daily basis that drives the price up depending on how much cash the fund is taking in and then when all that interest is paid out as a dividend it for lack of a better word resets the price back to the Baseline how much the price increased increases is simply a factor of interest rates as esgv will accumulate more interest and Rise that price higher when interest rates are high compared to when they're alone so the pros to holding a short-term treasury ETF like esgv is that it's extremely price stable you're not risking loss on your investment like you would with a stock ETF like even an S&amp;P 500 ETF it's liquid you can sell your shares and get your money out at any time and you'll get all the interest benefits of t- bills which usually beat a high yield savings account without any of the work of having to buy them individually and there are some cons to an ETF like esub as well first as with any ETF there is a management fee an expense ratio in the case of esgv is 0.09% which is about as close to zero as you can find but that still is 0.09% higher than any other option we've discussed so far and because esgv is an ETF you might want to think twice about using it for your short-term saving especially if you plan on dipping into it frequently because it can create a much more complicated tax filing compared to any of the other short-term Investments we have on this list selling shares and getting some cash out will probably result in there's some capital gains you have to deal with and I mentioned dividends earlier well eso's dividends aren't true qualified dividends like you'd get from a stock or a stock ETF esub is just passing all that t- bill interest back on to you so it'll be taxed as normal interest not the lower qualified dividend rate even though it is coming from an ETF also because it's an ETF it holds small amounts of nonte Bill things and you're not directly buying and holding the t- bills so it's not completely exempt from state and local taxes like t- bills and ibonds are instead earnings from Esco are only 96.45% exempt from those state and local income taxes like the expense ratio a very small amount that likely won't matter much at all but still something you should probably be aware of before inves so instead of Esco instead of an ETF maybe you just want to consider investing in t bills directly as we've established t- bills are short-term government bonds they

#savingmoney #financialfreedom #financialindependence","Kind: captions Language: en saving $225,000 is one of the most important Financial Milestones you can reach in order to transform your life from living paycheck to paycheck to actually thriving financially and in this video I'll show you exactly why did you know that the average American says they don't have enough savings to deal with a $1,000 emergency my name is Jay and I don't want that to be you so from here on out I'm going to be your personal guide to mastering your money so that you can stop worrying about your finances and all those unexpected expenses life throws at us to put you in a spot where you will Thrive financially and can start enjoying the rest of your life and it's my belief that once you get $255,000 saved everything changes and you can begin to do just that I know you're thinking why $25,000 did you just pick a number out of thin air so I'd click on this video first off how dare you secondly no I do think that saving an amount like $25,000 is extremely important but psychologically and practically and you'll see why I chose that specific amount in just a few minutes because this is all something I have personally experienced now this is something I don't hear a lot of people in the finance space talking about because it seems like everyone is only focused on saving the absolute bare minimum needed to prevent catastrophe but once you hit that $25,000 Milestone it will have transformed your financial life and open up a whole new world of possibilities for you because first off unless you're someone making multiple hundreds of thousands of dollar a year and if you are why are you watching this in order to save up 25 Grand you're going to need how to learn how to budget and control your money you're going to need to analyze your expenses against your income and make conscious decisions about what you do with your money every time you get paid you have to go through a process with your paycheck deciding what money gets spent and what money gets saved you just can't get the $225,000 saved without a level of awareness and control over what's happening with every dollar you earn and it's by going through that process having awareness over your money and taking control over where it goes that you build the essential skills and habits that everyone who's mastered their money possesses which will make it so much easier to continue moving forward saving investing and building the level of wealth you desire but there's another reason why saving $25,000 is such a game changer and it's because once you've built those essential skills and habits to save that much you really get to see and feel the effects of compound interest on your money you start to feel like your money is working for you finally we tend to only think about compounding when it comes to to the long term and what our investments in the stock market will look like returning 7 8% per year on average over a span of decades but compound interest isn't something you should ignore when talking about your short-term savings as well cuz $25,000 is a substantial amount of money and at current interest rates having 25k in your bank account you'll see it earning around $100 a month in interest $100 a month isn't going to turn you into Bill Gates but it is enough where you'll start to see your account balance steadily growing each and every month month it'll start to feel like your money is working for you instead of you always working for your money and that's a powerful feeling and again just mentally it's really nice to see monthly interest payments coming into your account that you know could cover your cell phone bill or fund your ever growing collection of obscure streaming services you'll be able to say yeah Netflix and Hulu this month without breaking a sweat basically turning you into the Jeff Bezos of your friend group but all jokes aside $225,000 it's just nice to have it's a financial safety net it means you'll be able to cover just about any unexpected expense that will pop up you won't have to stress as much when your car needs repairs and you won't be stuck frantically Googling how do I wash my clothes by hand if your washing machine up and dies because you'll have prepared yourself and given yourself the financial buffer to handle all those annoyances when they inevitably arise I really can't overstate that there is a big mindset shift that happens when you save $25,000 and is something that I have experienced firsthand for the longest time I was doing everything right pouring money into my retirement accounts watching my investments grow and still I was stressed about money I'm talking anxiety over buying groceries for the family stressed I mean how are people out there buying new cars and taking vacations and upgrading their kitchens when I'm struggling while being so financially responsible do they all make only fans content on the side am I the only one without a rich family member that left them in inheritance nope it turns out I wasn't managing my money as well as I thought I was I was saving super aggressively so that future me 20 years down the line would be living large but totally ignoring the fact that current me had a life to live and deserved a little Financial Security as well so I made a shift I decided I'm going to keep a more robust emergency fund around yes I had to sacrifice some of the money I was putting towards my retirement accounts to do it but I got to say it was worth it because when I finally got up to that level of having 20 $25,000 saved I noticed just about all the stress and anxiety I was having over money disappeared not only do I feel secure in my ability to handle any obstacle that might arise but there was a definite shift in my mindset from always feeling like I was playing defense with my money to now confidently playing offense I was more free to plan how I want to use my money to make my life more enjoyable now rather than just some distant date off into the future it really is like a switch that goes off when you hit a milestone like $25,000 that it just lets you let go of so much of that paycheck to paycheck stress it allows you to focus on those long-term goals without sacrificing today in order to do so but saving 25k just doesn't make you feel more secure and like you have a leg up on everyone else it provides some tangible real world benefits that you might not otherwise get without that much saved because when you have 25k saved up you'll have better Financial opportunities of available to you when you go to the bank looking for a mortgage or a car loan when they take a look at your assets and your credit history you're just going to look like a much safer bet to them not only are you someone they're more likely to give a loan to but you're more likely to get a better rate on that loan because you have enough to put down a sizable down payments again this is something I'm talking from experience on when my wife and I bought our current house we were luckily in the position where we had a very sizable amount of money saved up and we actually did something they call buying points on mortgage where we paid I think it was $5,000 more upfront in order to reduce our interest rate on our mortgage by half a perc we took it all the way down to 2.15% locked in for the next 30 Years it already looked like a great move when mortgage rates shot up to 7% earlier this year but since we plan on staying in this house long term we'll easily see the return on that investment and more regardless of what interest rates do in the future and trust me I understand some of you watch this and think that having $225,000 saved up is Amateur hour that's just some walking around money for you and some of you will call me out of touch because you can barely scrape together $25 let alone 25,000 you'll probably tell me it's not even possible to do in the first place but I believe because of the discipline and the dedication needed in order to save up $225,000 that it is an important milestone in anyone's Financial life now the one question you're probably all wondering but I haven't answered yet is where should I be saving this $25,000 to begin with there are a lot of options out there high yield savings accounts t- bills ibonds or you know that drawer in your kitchen where everything just kind of disappears some of those options are better than others which is why I made this video that you should watch next to make sure you're making the best choices investing your cash and your short-term savings so click here and let's put some fuel on that fire in your journey to $225,000 thanks for watching this video and I'll see you over in that next one soon","This video argues that saving $25,000 is a pivotal financial milestone, capable of transforming one's life from living paycheck-to-paycheck to thriving. The speaker highlights four core benefits of reaching this specific amount:

1.  **Development of Essential Financial Skills:** It compels individuals to learn crucial money management habits like budgeting and conscious spending, building fundamental financial control.
2.  **Tangible Experience of Compound Interest:** Accumulating $25,000 allows for noticeable passive income (e.g., $100/month from high-yield accounts), providing a powerful psychological feeling of money working for you.
3.  **Creation of a Robust Financial Safety Net:** This sum provides a significant buffer against unexpected expenses, drastically reducing financial stress and shifting one's mindset from defensive to offensive money management.
4.  **Access to Better Financial Opportunities:** Substantial savings make individuals appear as safer borrowers, leading to better interest rates on loans like mortgages, as illustrated by the speaker's personal experience securing a low mortgage rate.

The speaker emphasizes that the discipline and dedication required to reach this milestone are paramount, regardless of specific saving vehicles or market conditions, asserting its fundamental importance as a foundational step for financial well-being.",Netflix,0.9,0.1

think that saving an amount like $25,000 is extremely important but psychologically and practically and you'll see why I chose that specific amount in just a few minutes because this is all something I have personally experienced now this is something I don't hear a lot of people in the finance space talking about because it seems like everyone is only focused on saving the absolute bare minimum needed to prevent catastrophe but once you hit that $25,000 Milestone it will have transformed your financial life and open up a whole new world of possibilities for you because first off unless you're someone making multiple hundreds of thousands of dollar a year and if you are why are you watching this in order to save up 25 Grand you're going to need how to learn how to budget and control your money you're going to need to analyze your expenses against your income and make conscious decisions about what you do with your money every time you get paid you have to go through a process with your paycheck deciding what money gets spent and what money gets saved you just can't get the $225,000 saved without a level of awareness and control over what's happening with every dollar you earn and it's by going through that process having awareness over your money and taking control over where it goes that you build the essential skills and habits that everyone who's mastered their money possesses which will make it so much easier to continue moving forward saving investing and building the level of wealth you desire but there's another reason why saving $25,000 is such a game changer and it's because once you've built those essential skills and habits to save that much you really get to see and feel the effects of compound interest on your money you start to feel like your money is working for you finally we tend to only think about compounding when it comes to to the long term and what our investments in the stock market will look like returning 7 8% per year on average over a span of decades but compound interest isn't something you should ignore when talking about your short-term savings as well cuz $25,000 is a substantial amount of money and at current interest rates having 25k in your bank account you'll see it earning around $100 a month in interest $100 a month isn't going to turn you into Bill Gates but it is enough where you'll start to see your account balance steadily growing each and every month month it'll start to feel like your money is working for you instead of you always working for your money and that's a powerful feeling and again just mentally it's really nice to see monthly interest payments coming into your account that you know could cover your cell phone bill or fund your ever growing collection of obscure streaming services you'll be able to say yeah Netflix and Hulu this month without breaking a sweat basically turning you into the Jeff Bezos of your friend group but all jokes aside $225,000 it's just nice to have it's a financial safety net it means you'll be able to cover just about any unexpected expense that will pop up you won't have to stress as much when your car needs repairs and you won't be stuck frantically Googling how do I wash my clothes by hand if your washing machine up and dies because you'll have prepared yourself and given yourself the financial buffer to handle all those annoyances when they inevitably arise I really can't overstate that there is a big mindset shift that happens when you save $25,000 and is something that I have experienced firsthand for the longest time I was doing everything right pouring money into my retirement accounts watching my investments grow and still I was stressed about money I'm talking anxiety over buying groceries for the family stressed I mean how are people out there buying new cars and taking vacations and upgrading their kitchens when I'm struggling while being so financially responsible do they all make only fans content on the side am I the only one without a rich family member that left them in inheritance nope it turns out I wasn't managing my money as well as I thought I was I was saving super aggressively so that future me 20 years down the line would be living large but totally ignoring the fact that current me had a life to live and deserved a little Financial Security as well so I made a shift I decided I'm going to keep a more robust emergency fund around yes I had to sacrifice some of the money I was putting towards my retirement accounts to do it but I got to say it was worth it because when I finally got up to that level of having 20 $25,000 saved I noticed just about all the stress and anxiety I was having over money disappeared not only do I feel secure in my ability to handle any obstacle that might arise but there was a definite shift in my mindset from always feeling like I was playing defense with my money to now confidently playing offense I was more free to plan how I want to use my money to make my life more enjoyable now rather than just some distant date off into the future it really is like a switch that goes off when you hit a milestone like $25,000 that it just lets you let go of so much of that paycheck to paycheck stress it allows you to focus on those long-term goals without sacrificing today in order to do so but saving 25k just doesn't make you feel more secure and like you have a leg up on everyone else it provides some tangible real world benefits that you might not otherwise get without that much saved because when you have 25k saved up you'll have better Financial opportunities of available to you when you go to the bank looking for a mortgage or a car loan when they take a look at your assets and your credit history you're just going to look like a much safer bet to them not only are you someone they're more likely to give a loan to but you're more likely to get a better rate on that loan because you have enough to put down a sizable down payments again this is something I'm talking from experience on when my wife and I bought our current house we were luckily in the position where we had a very sizable amount of money saved up and we actually did something they call buying points on mortgage where we paid I think it was $5,000 more upfront in order to reduce our interest rate on our mortgage by half a perc we took it all the way down to 2.15% locked in for the next 30 Years it already looked like a great move when mortgage rates shot up to 7% earlier this year but since we plan on staying in this house long term we'll easily see the return on that investment and more regardless of what interest rates do in the future and trust me I understand some of you watch this and think that having $225,000 saved up is Amateur hour that's just some walking around money for you and some of you will call me out of touch because you can barely scrape together $25 let alone 25,000 you'll probably tell me it's not even possible to do in the first place but I believe because of the discipline and the dedication needed in order to save up $225,000 that it is an important milestone in anyone's Financial life now the one question you're probably all wondering but I haven't answered yet is where should I be saving this $25,000 to begin with there are a lot of options out there high yield savings accounts t- bills ibonds or you know that drawer in your kitchen where everything just kind of disappears some of those options are better than others which is why I made this video that you should watch next to make sure you're making the best choices investing your cash and your short-term savings so click here and let's put some fuel on that fire in your journey to $225,000 thanks for watching this video and I'll see you over in that next one soon","This video argues that saving $25,000 is a pivotal financial milestone, capable of transforming one's life from living paycheck-to-paycheck to thriving. The speaker highlights four core benefits of reaching this specific amount:

1.  **Development of Essential Financial Skills:** It compels individuals to learn crucial money management habits like budgeting and conscious spending, building fundamental financial control.
2.  **Tangible Experience of Compound Interest:** Accumulating $25,000 allows for noticeable passive income (e.g., $100/month from high-yield accounts), providing a powerful psychological feeling of money working for you.
3.  **Creation of a Robust Financial Safety Net:** This sum provides a significant buffer against unexpected expenses, drastically reducing financial stress and shifting one's mindset from defensive to offensive money management.
4.  **Access to Better Financial Opportunities:** Substantial savings make individuals appear as safer borrowers, leading to better interest rates on loans like mortgages, as illustrated by the speaker's personal experience securing a low mortgage rate.

The speaker emphasizes that the discipline and dedication required to reach this milestone are paramount, regardless of specific saving vehicles or market conditions, asserting its fundamental importance as a foundational step for financial well-being.",Hulu,0.9,0.1

#investing #robinhood #indexfunds","Kind: captions Language: en for the past 365 days I've been investing $5 a day into the stock market every day and today I'm going to share exactly how much money I've made but first we have to back up a little bit because this isn't just some stupid challenge I made up for the sake of making content There's an actual reason and meaning behind this we all have bad habits I'm sure we'd love to quit don't lie I'm sure you do and you know how hard it can be for some of you it may be smoking for others it may be just ordering too much takeout food and me I have a bad habit I really wanted to quit but was having a really hard time letting go of so really this is a story of turning a bad habit into a good one because you see I have a morning routine except mine doesn't involve ice baths and meditation it involves daily stops at a convenience store on the way to work to buy one of these I am addicted to energy drinks and it's not even that I really need the jolt of caffeine most days it's just that they taste good and I got in the habit of having something flavorful to sip on as I began my workday but here's the thing there's no way these things can be healthy for you and on top of that they're pretty damn expensive too anywhere from $3 to $5 a can depending on which one I pull out of the cooler that day so not only do I have an unhealthy habit I'm looking to kick but a rather expensive one as well but just telling myself that I was going to stop and today was the day I was just going to drive by and continue on my way to work wasn't really working and I'm sure a lot of you are the same way but I am way more likely to do something if I'm incentivized to do it so in order to kick the bad habit of buying a Red Bull on the way to work every day I needed to give myself an incentive to stop so I decided to try to end one habit by starting another except I'd be turning a bad habit into a good one instead of spending all that money on an energy drink every morning I'd take it and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 instead trust me I know it's one of the most worn out and repeated cliches in all of personal finance that if you only stopped buying Starbucks coffee every morning and invested that money instead that after 30 years you'd have a million dollars which while true from a purely mathematical standpoint is advice I absolutely hate and the reason I hate that advice so much is because quitting the little things that may bring you Joy isn't the way to build wealth it's much better better to focus your time and energy on the bigger wins in your financial life you could save yourself more money in 10 minutes of negotiating the price of your next car than you would in 2 years of skipping your morning coffees but here's the thing my Red Bull habit doesn't really bring me much joy it's not something that's making my life any better and it's not really something I want to continue doing it's just a bad habit I've fallen into and I'm kind of getting annoyed at how much money I waste on it so I decided I'm spending $3 to5 every day on these stupid things why don't I test out that old cliche and invest that money every day instead of buying the energy drinks that way not only do I have a healthier morning routine but I get a little bit richer in the process that's a win-win if I've ever seen one and if you're unfamiliar investing this way is called dollar cost averaging it's investing strategy where you don't time the highs or lows of the market you invest consistently through all the ups and downs of the market with the thought that at the end of the day all of that volatility and its impact on your portfolio evens out and in just a minute we'll jump inside my account and I'll show you exactly how much money I've made over the course of this challenge so far and you'll be able to see all of those ups and downs that the market took over the span of just a single year but first a little more about how I've structured this Challenge and we'll start with where I'm investing at and for this challenge I'm using a Robin Hood account and I chose Robin Hood mainly because I already had the account sitting there with no money in it doing nothing and Robin Hood has an automatic investing feature where I can set it up to pull $5 a day every day from my bank account and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 automatically because those of you who know me and have watched my videos in the past know the more automated and hands-off you can keep your investing the more likely you'll stick with your plan and end up seeing success over the long run secondly why did I choose the S&amp;P 500 and that part is simple the the S&amp;P 500 is the gold standard as to what everyone else measures their Investments against when you hear an investor say they're trying to beat the market or an investor can't beat the market it's the S&amp;P 500 they're using as that Benchmark for the market and to almost no one's surprise almost all investors who set out to beat the S&amp;P 500 fail in the long run another important factor in choosing the S&amp;P 500 and if you're someone who can only afford to invest smaller amounts of money at any given time this is important your money simply goes further when you're investing in a broad market index fund like the S&amp;P 500 by investing in the S&amp;P 500 or more specifically the ETF vo which I'm using for this challenge my money gets invested in apple Nvidia Amazon and all the other top companies you hear so much about I'm Diversified into a complete stock portfolio from my first $5 if I tried to build my own portfolio stocks on $5 a day it would take me a really long time to build a diversified portfolio with any sort of meaningful amount of money in any of those given stocks so now let's get into how much money I've actually made by investing $5 a day over the past year now it's also important to note the stock market isn't open 365 days a year and like I said I want to keep my investments simple and hands off so I didn't try to Tinker and make up for lost days where the market was closed for weekends or holidays or whatever else I only made my $5 Investments on open trading days for the stock market I made my first $5 investment on August 1st 2023 and 12 months later I had invested $1,250 of my own money which was good for a whopping 2.82 shares of the vo ETF and when we're talking about investing let's be real that number may not seem big at all but let's remember that number also represents the amount of money I would have spent buying energy drinks at the convenience store instead over that same time period so in that context $1,250 seems massive now my first purchase of the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF vo was made at a price of $ 41922 and by dollar cost averaging every day over 12 months my average purchase price of all of those individual $5 Investments worked out to be $443 9 cents per share and there have been plenty of dips and bumps in the road along the way but the market has mostly gone up over the past year and at day 365 of this experiment vo was trading at a price of $563 per share $10.55 came from vo's dividends which were of course reinvested directly into more shares of VO to help with my compounding returns just look at the growth from my first dividend which was a whopping 75 to my most recent one of $464 and you can kind of see how that compounding works and another thing I really wanted to show with this experiment is that you don't need a ton of money to see the benefits of putting it to work in the stock market even a trivial sum of $5 per day can eventually grow into something worthwhile and my account which started at $0 365 days ago has grown to $1,432 54 a gain of 15 03 or just over $187 you can see from just the last year how the growth and the dividends both start to compound even when we're talking about small amounts of money and it's not bad when you consider the alternative the plan for now is to keep this experiment going and if you have any ideas for another experiment I can run alongside this definitely let me know in the comments below thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one","A financial content creator demonstrated the power of consistent, small-scale investing by redirecting a daily $5 spending habit into the S&P 500 ETF (VOO) for one year. This experiment highlighted the effectiveness of **dollar-cost averaging**, the importance of **automating investments**, and the benefit of **immediate diversification** offered by broad market index funds like the S&P 500.

Over 12 months, a total investment of $1,250 yielded a 15.03% return, amounting to a $187.54 gain, with an additional $10.55 in reinvested dividends. The key insight is that significant capital is not a prerequisite to begin investing; even a seemingly ""trivial"" sum like $5 per day, consistently applied, can meaningfully accumulate and effectively leverage the power of compounding, proving a superior financial practice to discretionary spending.",Red Bull,0.9,-0.2

#investing #robinhood #indexfunds","Kind: captions Language: en for the past 365 days I've been investing $5 a day into the stock market every day and today I'm going to share exactly how much money I've made but first we have to back up a little bit because this isn't just some stupid challenge I made up for the sake of making content There's an actual reason and meaning behind this we all have bad habits I'm sure we'd love to quit don't lie I'm sure you do and you know how hard it can be for some of you it may be smoking for others it may be just ordering too much takeout food and me I have a bad habit I really wanted to quit but was having a really hard time letting go of so really this is a story of turning a bad habit into a good one because you see I have a morning routine except mine doesn't involve ice baths and meditation it involves daily stops at a convenience store on the way to work to buy one of these I am addicted to energy drinks and it's not even that I really need the jolt of caffeine most days it's just that they taste good and I got in the habit of having something flavorful to sip on as I began my workday but here's the thing there's no way these things can be healthy for you and on top of that they're pretty damn expensive too anywhere from $3 to $5 a can depending on which one I pull out of the cooler that day so not only do I have an unhealthy habit I'm looking to kick but a rather expensive one as well but just telling myself that I was going to stop and today was the day I was just going to drive by and continue on my way to work wasn't really working and I'm sure a lot of you are the same way but I am way more likely to do something if I'm incentivized to do it so in order to kick the bad habit of buying a Red Bull on the way to work every day I needed to give myself an incentive to stop so I decided to try to end one habit by starting another except I'd be turning a bad habit into a good one instead of spending all that money on an energy drink every morning I'd take it and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 instead trust me I know it's one of the most worn out and repeated cliches in all of personal finance that if you only stopped buying Starbucks coffee every morning and invested that money instead that after 30 years you'd have a million dollars which while true from a purely mathematical standpoint is advice I absolutely hate and the reason I hate that advice so much is because quitting the little things that may bring you Joy isn't the way to build wealth it's much better better to focus your time and energy on the bigger wins in your financial life you could save yourself more money in 10 minutes of negotiating the price of your next car than you would in 2 years of skipping your morning coffees but here's the thing my Red Bull habit doesn't really bring me much joy it's not something that's making my life any better and it's not really something I want to continue doing it's just a bad habit I've fallen into and I'm kind of getting annoyed at how much money I waste on it so I decided I'm spending $3 to5 every day on these stupid things why don't I test out that old cliche and invest that money every day instead of buying the energy drinks that way not only do I have a healthier morning routine but I get a little bit richer in the process that's a win-win if I've ever seen one and if you're unfamiliar investing this way is called dollar cost averaging it's investing strategy where you don't time the highs or lows of the market you invest consistently through all the ups and downs of the market with the thought that at the end of the day all of that volatility and its impact on your portfolio evens out and in just a minute we'll jump inside my account and I'll show you exactly how much money I've made over the course of this challenge so far and you'll be able to see all of those ups and downs that the market took over the span of just a single year but first a little more about how I've structured this Challenge and we'll start with where I'm investing at and for this challenge I'm using a Robin Hood account and I chose Robin Hood mainly because I already had the account sitting there with no money in it doing nothing and Robin Hood has an automatic investing feature where I can set it up to pull $5 a day every day from my bank account and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 automatically because those of you who know me and have watched my videos in the past know the more automated and hands-off you can keep your investing the more likely you'll stick with your plan and end up seeing success over the long run secondly why did I choose the S&amp;P 500 and that part is simple the the S&amp;P 500 is the gold standard as to what everyone else measures their Investments against when you hear an investor say they're trying to beat the market or an investor can't beat the market it's the S&amp;P 500 they're using as that Benchmark for the market and to almost no one's surprise almost all investors who set out to beat the S&amp;P 500 fail in the long run another important factor in choosing the S&amp;P 500 and if you're someone who can only afford to invest smaller amounts of money at any given time this is important your money simply goes further when you're investing in a broad market index fund like the S&amp;P 500 by investing in the S&amp;P 500 or more specifically the ETF vo which I'm using for this challenge my money gets invested in apple Nvidia Amazon and all the other top companies you hear so much about I'm Diversified into a complete stock portfolio from my first $5 if I tried to build my own portfolio stocks on $5 a day it would take me a really long time to build a diversified portfolio with any sort of meaningful amount of money in any of those given stocks so now let's get into how much money I've actually made by investing $5 a day over the past year now it's also important to note the stock market isn't open 365 days a year and like I said I want to keep my investments simple and hands off so I didn't try to Tinker and make up for lost days where the market was closed for weekends or holidays or whatever else I only made my $5 Investments on open trading days for the stock market I made my first $5 investment on August 1st 2023 and 12 months later I had invested $1,250 of my own money which was good for a whopping 2.82 shares of the vo ETF and when we're talking about investing let's be real that number may not seem big at all but let's remember that number also represents the amount of money I would have spent buying energy drinks at the convenience store instead over that same time period so in that context $1,250 seems massive now my first purchase of the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF vo was made at a price of $ 41922 and by dollar cost averaging every day over 12 months my average purchase price of all of those individual $5 Investments worked out to be $443 9 cents per share and there have been plenty of dips and bumps in the road along the way but the market has mostly gone up over the past year and at day 365 of this experiment vo was trading at a price of $563 per share $10.55 came from vo's dividends which were of course reinvested directly into more shares of VO to help with my compounding returns just look at the growth from my first dividend which was a whopping 75 to my most recent one of $464 and you can kind of see how that compounding works and another thing I really wanted to show with this experiment is that you don't need a ton of money to see the benefits of putting it to work in the stock market even a trivial sum of $5 per day can eventually grow into something worthwhile and my account which started at $0 365 days ago has grown to $1,432 54 a gain of 15 03 or just over $187 you can see from just the last year how the growth and the dividends both start to compound even when we're talking about small amounts of money and it's not bad when you consider the alternative the plan for now is to keep this experiment going and if you have any ideas for another experiment I can run alongside this definitely let me know in the comments below thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one","A financial content creator demonstrated the power of consistent, small-scale investing by redirecting a daily $5 spending habit into the S&P 500 ETF (VOO) for one year. This experiment highlighted the effectiveness of **dollar-cost averaging**, the importance of **automating investments**, and the benefit of **immediate diversification** offered by broad market index funds like the S&P 500.

Over 12 months, a total investment of $1,250 yielded a 15.03% return, amounting to a $187.54 gain, with an additional $10.55 in reinvested dividends. The key insight is that significant capital is not a prerequisite to begin investing; even a seemingly ""trivial"" sum like $5 per day, consistently applied, can meaningfully accumulate and effectively leverage the power of compounding, proving a superior financial practice to discretionary spending.",Robinhood,1.0,0.5

#investing #robinhood #indexfunds","Kind: captions Language: en for the past 365 days I've been investing $5 a day into the stock market every day and today I'm going to share exactly how much money I've made but first we have to back up a little bit because this isn't just some stupid challenge I made up for the sake of making content There's an actual reason and meaning behind this we all have bad habits I'm sure we'd love to quit don't lie I'm sure you do and you know how hard it can be for some of you it may be smoking for others it may be just ordering too much takeout food and me I have a bad habit I really wanted to quit but was having a really hard time letting go of so really this is a story of turning a bad habit into a good one because you see I have a morning routine except mine doesn't involve ice baths and meditation it involves daily stops at a convenience store on the way to work to buy one of these I am addicted to energy drinks and it's not even that I really need the jolt of caffeine most days it's just that they taste good and I got in the habit of having something flavorful to sip on as I began my workday but here's the thing there's no way these things can be healthy for you and on top of that they're pretty damn expensive too anywhere from $3 to $5 a can depending on which one I pull out of the cooler that day so not only do I have an unhealthy habit I'm looking to kick but a rather expensive one as well but just telling myself that I was going to stop and today was the day I was just going to drive by and continue on my way to work wasn't really working and I'm sure a lot of you are the same way but I am way more likely to do something if I'm incentivized to do it so in order to kick the bad habit of buying a Red Bull on the way to work every day I needed to give myself an incentive to stop so I decided to try to end one habit by starting another except I'd be turning a bad habit into a good one instead of spending all that money on an energy drink every morning I'd take it and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 instead trust me I know it's one of the most worn out and repeated cliches in all of personal finance that if you only stopped buying Starbucks coffee every morning and invested that money instead that after 30 years you'd have a million dollars which while true from a purely mathematical standpoint is advice I absolutely hate and the reason I hate that advice so much is because quitting the little things that may bring you Joy isn't the way to build wealth it's much better better to focus your time and energy on the bigger wins in your financial life you could save yourself more money in 10 minutes of negotiating the price of your next car than you would in 2 years of skipping your morning coffees but here's the thing my Red Bull habit doesn't really bring me much joy it's not something that's making my life any better and it's not really something I want to continue doing it's just a bad habit I've fallen into and I'm kind of getting annoyed at how much money I waste on it so I decided I'm spending $3 to5 every day on these stupid things why don't I test out that old cliche and invest that money every day instead of buying the energy drinks that way not only do I have a healthier morning routine but I get a little bit richer in the process that's a win-win if I've ever seen one and if you're unfamiliar investing this way is called dollar cost averaging it's investing strategy where you don't time the highs or lows of the market you invest consistently through all the ups and downs of the market with the thought that at the end of the day all of that volatility and its impact on your portfolio evens out and in just a minute we'll jump inside my account and I'll show you exactly how much money I've made over the course of this challenge so far and you'll be able to see all of those ups and downs that the market took over the span of just a single year but first a little more about how I've structured this Challenge and we'll start with where I'm investing at and for this challenge I'm using a Robin Hood account and I chose Robin Hood mainly because I already had the account sitting there with no money in it doing nothing and Robin Hood has an automatic investing feature where I can set it up to pull $5 a day every day from my bank account and invest it into the S&amp;P 500 automatically because those of you who know me and have watched my videos in the past know the more automated and hands-off you can keep your investing the more likely you'll stick with your plan and end up seeing success over the long run secondly why did I choose the S&amp;P 500 and that part is simple the the S&amp;P 500 is the gold standard as to what everyone else measures their Investments against when you hear an investor say they're trying to beat the market or an investor can't beat the market it's the S&amp;P 500 they're using as that Benchmark for the market and to almost no one's surprise almost all investors who set out to beat the S&amp;P 500 fail in the long run another important factor in choosing the S&amp;P 500 and if you're someone who can only afford to invest smaller amounts of money at any given time this is important your money simply goes further when you're investing in a broad market index fund like the S&amp;P 500 by investing in the S&amp;P 500 or more specifically the ETF vo which I'm using for this challenge my money gets invested in apple Nvidia Amazon and all the other top companies you hear so much about I'm Diversified into a complete stock portfolio from my first $5 if I tried to build my own portfolio stocks on $5 a day it would take me a really long time to build a diversified portfolio with any sort of meaningful amount of money in any of those given stocks so now let's get into how much money I've actually made by investing $5 a day over the past year now it's also important to note the stock market isn't open 365 days a year and like I said I want to keep my investments simple and hands off so I didn't try to Tinker and make up for lost days where the market was closed for weekends or holidays or whatever else I only made my $5 Investments on open trading days for the stock market I made my first $5 investment on August 1st 2023 and 12 months later I had invested $1,250 of my own money which was good for a whopping 2.82 shares of the vo ETF and when we're talking about investing let's be real that number may not seem big at all but let's remember that number also represents the amount of money I would have spent buying energy drinks at the convenience store instead over that same time period so in that context $1,250 seems massive now my first purchase of the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF vo was made at a price of $ 41922 and by dollar cost averaging every day over 12 months my average purchase price of all of those individual $5 Investments worked out to be $443 9 cents per share and there have been plenty of dips and bumps in the road along the way but the market has mostly gone up over the past year and at day 365 of this experiment vo was trading at a price of $563 per share $10.55 came from vo's dividends which were of course reinvested directly into more shares of VO to help with my compounding returns just look at the growth from my first dividend which was a whopping 75 to my most recent one of $464 and you can kind of see how that compounding works and another thing I really wanted to show with this experiment is that you don't need a ton of money to see the benefits of putting it to work in the stock market even a trivial sum of $5 per day can eventually grow into something worthwhile and my account which started at $0 365 days ago has grown to $1,432 54 a gain of 15 03 or just over $187 you can see from just the last year how the growth and the dividends both start to compound even when we're talking about small amounts of money and it's not bad when you consider the alternative the plan for now is to keep this experiment going and if you have any ideas for another experiment I can run alongside this definitely let me know in the comments below

#tbills #treasurybills #ibonds #getfinvest #personalfinance","Kind: captions Language: en inflation has slowed interest rates are peaking and you're wondering should I still be putting my money towards treasury bills and ibonds in this video I'll give you the answer to that question and let you in on my personal strategy for how much I'll be investing in t- bills and ibonds this year the draw to T bills over the past few years has been easy to explain there was a lot of instability and fear surrounding the economy and unlike stocks treasuries are completely safe investment backed by the full faith of the US government so as long as you hold your treasuries until maturity you're guaranteed not to lose any of the principle you put into them in the first place and investors have been craving that kind of safety the fact that t- bills have been paying record high interest rates on top of that only made them that much more appealing even now t- bells are yielding over 5.3% that's higher than even the best high yield savings accounts you'll find but we're in a different Market than we were in 2023 or 2022 stocks are soaring Bitcoin is at alltime highs and it generally feels like good times are here again so should you be putting your money into t- bills and locking in 5% when you could be buying a ticket to the moon and dumping that money into Bitcoin or Nvidia it's a legitimate question to ask yourself and I'll give you a few reasons why I think that t- bills and ibonds are still worth your time in 2024 as I sit here and record this we're in the middle of tax season I just filed my return last week and while it was nice earning a nice high interest rate on my savings account all year long it became a little less fun when I filed my taxes because as some of you may know I live in New York and any of that interest I earned on my high yield savings account over the course of the year is taxed not only by the federal government but by New York State as well and chances are you're in the same boat as I am because 41 out of the 50 states have a state income tax but if you invest that money in t- bills not only do you get a higher interest rate than high yield savings accounts are paying but any interest you earn on treasuries is exempt from state income taxes meaning the actual interest rate you're earning by putting your money in the treasuries is in reality that much higher than what you're earning on your high yield savings account and no matter who we are each one of us still has a need for safety in our portfolio Safety Not only from loss but from inflation and from changing interest rates because interest rates right now are the highest they've been at since around 2007 and all signs are pointing to this maybe being the highest they're going to get for a while the possibility is they may even decrease in the near future and I think that opens up a unique opportunity not only in TB bills but also with ibonds which we'll talk more about in a minute the opportunity we have in t- bills right now is that if this really is the highest interest rates are going to get for a long time we can lock them in right now and protect ourselves against the possibility of them falling over the course of this year because once you buy a t bill you lock in that interest rate that's what you're going to earn on that investment no matter what it's not like your high yield savings account where the second that the FED Cuts interest rates your bank is going to follow suit and cut the interest rate they're paying you on your money and the longer term T bill you buy buy better off you'll be if and when the FED does decide to start cutting interest rates later this year or maybe even in the next a one-year T bill is currently paying right around 5% so you can lock in a guaranteed 5% and no risk return on your money by buying a 12-month T bill when the probability is that a year from now interest rates are going to be significantly lower than 5% my only word of caution here is to be sure you weigh the length of T Bill you're going to buy against when you may need access to that money because while you can sell t- bills early before maturity I always advise buying a length that you'll be comfortable with holding the whole way through we should also be a little careful on playing predictions on where interest rates might go if they might go higher or lower in the future because that just like timing the stock market is a game none of us are going to win now in my case my wife is in the market for a new car so we're going to have to pull a good chunk of money out of our savings to pay for it whenever she makes up her mind and decides what is is she wants to drive so I'm going to need to have access us some money fairly quickly and I don't want to lock that money up in a one-year T Bill if I'm going to need it in 2 or 3 months so instead what I'm doing with my T Bill Investments right now is I'm putting them towards the shortest term t- bills available which of course are the 4-we t- Bills and a weird Quirk we have going on right now is the 4-we T bills are actually paying a higher interest rate than the oneyear t bills but remember and I have to point this out because I got a lot of comments on my prior t- Bill videos the interest rates quoted for t- bills are the annual ized interest rate so a 4-we t bill paying 5.3% you're not getting 5.3% in that 4 weeks you're getting 4 weeks of an annualized 5.3% interest on your money so just don't let that trip you up and you'll be fine another thing I got a lot of comments about in my prior t- Bill videos which you should watch if you haven't is that using the treasury direct website to buy them is really clunky and not user friendly so that's why I'm also trying out a new app made specifically for buying treasury bills with it's called finvest and lets me buy t- bills straight from the app on my phone the only time I'm ever on an actual computer is when I'm at work or when I'm editing these videos the rest of the time I want to do things on my phone and I think one of the big advantages of finvest so far is it's so much easier to navigate than treasury direct or your brokerage website as I've mentioned in previous videos I use t- bills as a backup to my emergency Savings in a high yield savings account so I went and connected that savings account to finvest so anytime I want to move money from my savings into back up into t- bills I can do it quickly with just a few Taps on my phone I actually moved $1,000 over the other day that I want to put into a 4-we t- bill so I figured I'd give you a demonstration on how finvest works so here we go you can see I've got $1,000 cash in my in my finvest portfolio here I just click on invest it shows me each T Bill maturity length and what they're currently yielding I just pick the one I want which is the one month treasury bill at 5.35% right now I enter in how much I want to invest at that which of course course is my 4,000 I have there right now I click confirm and boom I just bought $1,000 worth of 4we T bills just like that and of course I'll leave a link to this finvest app down in the description of the video if you want to check them out go ahead and do that now a thing you have to remember t- Bells don't pay interest like a stock pays dividends or your bank pays you interest on your savings account instead when you buy the t- bill like I just did there you buy it at a discount which represents the amount of Interest you're going to earn when the t- bill matures so even though I just told Finn I want to buy $1,000 worth of 4-we T bills I'll only actually pay $990 some dollars for it right now I screwed up the math on that in one of my last t- bill videos and I can't even count how many comments I got correcting me about it so thank you for paying attention and being much better at math than me but once the t- bill matures that's when I get the full th000 so however much you enter that you want to buy in t bills whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $110,000 that's the amount you'll receive at maturity what you'll pay at the time of purchase is that amount less whatever interest you're going to earn t- bills aren't the only major opportunity we have right now when it comes to places we can park our cash ibonds while severely less hyped than they were a year or two ago are actually a much better investment opportunity right now than they were a year or so ago when they were paying like 99.6% interest that's because back when they were paying that 9% interest the entire interest rate that ibon was paying was the variable in inflation interest rate remember an ion's total interest rate is made up of a variable portion that changes with inflation and a fixed portion so you got a huge interest rate for 6 months because inflation was so high but as inflation has slowed the variable interest rate that ibonds pay has come down with it but like we just discussed with t- bills interest rates in general are so high right now ibonds are now paying a 1.3% fixed interest rate that is good for the life of the bond so that means even though when you go and look up the ibond interest rate right now it says they're paying 5.27 % obviously far lower than their peak of 99.62% a little over a year ago but they're actually a far more attractive option right now if you're playing on holding long term because any ibonds you buy right now through the end of April will beat inflation by 1.3% for as long as you hold the bond or 30 years whatever goes first and before you ask the answer is yes if you bought ibonds back a year or two ago when they were yielding 79% but the entire interest rate was the variable rate I do think it is a good idea to sell those I funds and Reby the new ones that carry the 1.3% fixed interest rate as long as you're planning on holding them for the long term it's worth taking that hit and paying the 3-month interest penalty to get out of the ones with no fixed interest rate into the ones at 1.3% fixed my plan is to completely max out my ibond allotment for 2024 I've already purchased $5,000 worth and I told the IRS I want my full tax refund coming to me in the form of ibond remember that lets you buy another $5,000 worth above and beyond the $110,000 limit for the other $55,000 though I'm going to wait until early to mid April to decide if I want to Max them all out now or wait until after April 30th in the event that that fixed interest rate ibonds are paying increases for the bonds that will be issued between May and October of 2024 because that fixed interest rate above and beyond the inflation rate will be a real benefit to my savings goals like paying for kids college someday because ibonds become even more attractive when used for educ a costs if you want to know more about that and several other unique ways you can use ibonds that you may not have thought about before be sure to click on this video now thanks for watching and I hope to see you there","Despite roaring equity and crypto markets, a financial analyst asserts that 2024 remains an excellent time to invest in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and I-Bonds, as they provide essential portfolio safety, inflation protection, and the opportunity to lock in high interest rates before potential future declines.

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are highlighted for their safety (U.S. government-backed, guaranteeing principal if held to maturity), attractive state tax-exempt yields (currently over 5.3% for shorter terms like 4-week, surpassing high-yield savings accounts), and the ability to lock in these potentially peaking rates. The speaker uses shorter-term T-Bills for liquidity, advising investors to align maturities with their cash needs, and recommends Finvest as an easy-to-use platform for purchases.

**I-Bonds** are now considered a ""much better investment opportunity"" for long-term holders due to a new, guaranteed 1.3% fixed interest rate, which ensures they will beat inflation for up to 30 years. This contrasts with previous I-Bonds that had a 0% fixed rate. The analyst advises strategically selling older 0% fixed-rate I-Bonds to repurchase new ones, even if it incurs a 3-month interest penalty. He plans to maximize his 2024 I-Bond allotment ($10,000 direct purchase + $5,000 via tax refund), delaying the tax refund portion until mid-April to potentially secure an even higher fixed rate for I-Bonds issued from May to October, noting their particular suitability for future expenses like education.",US government,0.8,0.5

some of you may know I live in New York and any of that interest I earned on my high yield savings account over the course of the year is taxed not only by the federal government but by New York State as well and chances are you're in the same boat as I am because 41 out of the 50 states have a state income tax but if you invest that money in t- bills not only do you get a higher interest rate than high yield savings accounts are paying but any interest you earn on treasuries is exempt from state income taxes meaning the actual interest rate you're earning by putting your money in the treasuries is in reality that much higher than what you're earning on your high yield savings account and no matter who we are each one of us still has a need for safety in our portfolio Safety Not only from loss but from inflation and from changing interest rates because interest rates right now are the highest they've been at since around 2007 and all signs are pointing to this maybe being the highest they're going to get for a while the possibility is they may even decrease in the near future and I think that opens up a unique opportunity not only in TB bills but also with ibonds which we'll talk more about in a minute the opportunity we have in t- bills right now is that if this really is the highest interest rates are going to get for a long time we can lock them in right now and protect ourselves against the possibility of them falling over the course of this year because once you buy a t bill you lock in that interest rate that's what you're going to earn on that investment no matter what it's not like your high yield savings account where the second that the FED Cuts interest rates your bank is going to follow suit and cut the interest rate they're paying you on your money and the longer term T bill you buy buy better off you'll be if and when the FED does decide to start cutting interest rates later this year or maybe even in the next a one-year T bill is currently paying right around 5% so you can lock in a guaranteed 5% and no risk return on your money by buying a 12-month T bill when the probability is that a year from now interest rates are going to be significantly lower than 5% my only word of caution here is to be sure you weigh the length of T Bill you're going to buy against when you may need access to that money because while you can sell t- bills early before maturity I always advise buying a length that you'll be comfortable with holding the whole way through we should also be a little careful on playing predictions on where interest rates might go if they might go higher or lower in the future because that just like timing the stock market is a game none of us are going to win now in my case my wife is in the market for a new car so we're going to have to pull a good chunk of money out of our savings to pay for it whenever she makes up her mind and decides what is is she wants to drive so I'm going to need to have access us some money fairly quickly and I don't want to lock that money up in a one-year T Bill if I'm going to need it in 2 or 3 months so instead what I'm doing with my T Bill Investments right now is I'm putting them towards the shortest term t- bills available which of course are the 4-we t- Bills and a weird Quirk we have going on right now is the 4-we T bills are actually paying a higher interest rate than the oneyear t bills but remember and I have to point this out because I got a lot of comments on my prior t- Bill videos the interest rates quoted for t- bills are the annual ized interest rate so a 4-we t bill paying 5.3% you're not getting 5.3% in that 4 weeks you're getting 4 weeks of an annualized 5.3% interest on your money so just don't let that trip you up and you'll be fine another thing I got a lot of comments about in my prior t- Bill videos which you should watch if you haven't is that using the treasury direct website to buy them is really clunky and not user friendly so that's why I'm also trying out a new app made specifically for buying treasury bills with it's called finvest and lets me buy t- bills straight from the app on my phone the only time I'm ever on an actual computer is when I'm at work or when I'm editing these videos the rest of the time I want to do things on my phone and I think one of the big advantages of finvest so far is it's so much easier to navigate than treasury direct or your brokerage website as I've mentioned in previous videos I use t- bills as a backup to my emergency Savings in a high yield savings account so I went and connected that savings account to finvest so anytime I want to move money from my savings into back up into t- bills I can do it quickly with just a few Taps on my phone I actually moved $1,000 over the other day that I want to put into a 4-we t- bill so I figured I'd give you a demonstration on how finvest works so here we go you can see I've got $1,000 cash in my in my finvest portfolio here I just click on invest it shows me each T Bill maturity length and what they're currently yielding I just pick the one I want which is the one month treasury bill at 5.35% right now I enter in how much I want to invest at that which of course course is my 4,000 I have there right now I click confirm and boom I just bought $1,000 worth of 4we T bills just like that and of course I'll leave a link to this finvest app down in the description of the video if you want to check them out go ahead and do that now a thing you have to remember t- Bells don't pay interest like a stock pays dividends or your bank pays you interest on your savings account instead when you buy the t- bill like I just did there you buy it at a discount which represents the amount of Interest you're going to earn when the t- bill matures so even though I just told Finn I want to buy $1,000 worth of 4-we T bills I'll only actually pay $990 some dollars for it right now I screwed up the math on that in one of my last t- bill videos and I can't even count how many comments I got correcting me about it so thank you for paying attention and being much better at math than me but once the t- bill matures that's when I get the full th000 so however much you enter that you want to buy in t bills whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $110,000 that's the amount you'll receive at maturity what you'll pay at the time of purchase is that amount less whatever interest you're going to earn t- bills aren't the only major opportunity we have right now when it comes to places we can park our cash ibonds while severely less hyped than they were a year or two ago are actually a much better investment opportunity right now than they were a year or so ago when they were paying like 99.6% interest that's because back when they were paying that 9% interest the entire interest rate that ibon was paying was the variable in inflation interest rate remember an ion's total interest rate is made up of a variable portion that changes with inflation and a fixed portion so you got a huge interest rate for 6 months because inflation was so high but as inflation has slowed the variable interest rate that ibonds pay has come down with it but like we just discussed with t- bills interest rates in general are so high right now ibonds are now paying a 1.3% fixed interest rate that is good for the life of the bond so that means even though when you go and look up the ibond interest rate right now it says they're paying 5.27 % obviously far lower than their peak of 99.62% a little over a year ago but they're actually a far more attractive option right now if you're playing on holding long term because any ibonds you buy right now through the end of April will beat inflation by 1.3% for as long as you hold the bond or 30 years whatever goes first and before you ask the answer is yes if you bought ibonds back a year or two ago when they were yielding 79% but the entire interest rate was the variable rate I do think it is a good idea to sell those I funds and Reby the new ones that carry the 1.3% fixed interest rate as long as you're planning on holding them for the long term it's worth taking that hit and paying the 3-month interest penalty to get out of the ones with no fixed interest rate into the ones at 1.3% fixed my plan is to completely max out my ibond allotment for 2024 I've already purchased $5,000 worth and I told the IRS I want my full tax refund coming to me in the form of ibond remember that lets you buy another $5,000 worth above and beyond the $110,000 limit for the other $55,000 though I'm going to wait until early to mid April to decide if I want to Max them all out now or wait until after April 30th in the event that that fixed interest rate ibonds are paying increases for the bonds that will be issued between May and October of 2024 because that fixed interest rate above and beyond the inflation rate will be a real benefit to my savings goals like paying for kids college someday because ibonds become even more attractive when used for educ a costs if you want to know more about that and several other unique ways you can use ibonds that you may not have thought about before be sure to click on this video now thanks for watching and I hope to see you there","Despite roaring equity and crypto markets, a financial analyst asserts that 2024 remains an excellent time to invest in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and I-Bonds, as they provide essential portfolio safety, inflation protection, and the opportunity to lock in high interest rates before potential future declines.

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are highlighted for their safety (U.S. government-backed, guaranteeing principal if held to maturity), attractive state tax-exempt yields (currently over 5.3% for shorter terms like 4-week, surpassing high-yield savings accounts), and the ability to lock in these potentially peaking rates. The speaker uses shorter-term T-Bills for liquidity, advising investors to align maturities with their cash needs, and recommends Finvest as an easy-to-use platform for purchases.

**I-Bonds** are now considered a ""much better investment opportunity"" for long-term holders due to a new, guaranteed 1.3% fixed interest rate, which ensures they will beat inflation for up to 30 years. This contrasts with previous I-Bonds that had a 0% fixed rate. The analyst advises strategically selling older 0% fixed-rate I-Bonds to repurchase new ones, even if it incurs a 3-month interest penalty. He plans to maximize his 2024 I-Bond allotment ($10,000 direct purchase + $5,000 via tax refund), delaying the tax refund portion until mid-April to potentially secure an even higher fixed rate for I-Bonds issued from May to October, noting their particular suitability for future expenses like education.",Bitcoin,0.4,0.7

and the longer term T bill you buy buy better off you'll be if and when the FED does decide to start cutting interest rates later this year or maybe even in the next a one-year T bill is currently paying right around 5% so you can lock in a guaranteed 5% and no risk return on your money by buying a 12-month T bill when the probability is that a year from now interest rates are going to be significantly lower than 5% my only word of caution here is to be sure you weigh the length of T Bill you're going to buy against when you may need access to that money because while you can sell t- bills early before maturity I always advise buying a length that you'll be comfortable with holding the whole way through we should also be a little careful on playing predictions on where interest rates might go if they might go higher or lower in the future because that just like timing the stock market is a game none of us are going to win now in my case my wife is in the market for a new car so we're going to have to pull a good chunk of money out of our savings to pay for it whenever she makes up her mind and decides what is is she wants to drive so I'm going to need to have access us some money fairly quickly and I don't want to lock that money up in a one-year T Bill if I'm going to need it in 2 or 3 months so instead what I'm doing with my T Bill Investments right now is I'm putting them towards the shortest term t- bills available which of course are the 4-we t- Bills and a weird Quirk we have going on right now is the 4-we T bills are actually paying a higher interest rate than the oneyear t bills but remember and I have to point this out because I got a lot of comments on my prior t- Bill videos the interest rates quoted for t- bills are the annual ized interest rate so a 4-we t bill paying 5.3% you're not getting 5.3% in that 4 weeks you're getting 4 weeks of an annualized 5.3% interest on your money so just don't let that trip you up and you'll be fine another thing I got a lot of comments about in my prior t- Bill videos which you should watch if you haven't is that using the treasury direct website to buy them is really clunky and not user friendly so that's why I'm also trying out a new app made specifically for buying treasury bills with it's called finvest and lets me buy t- bills straight from the app on my phone the only time I'm ever on an actual computer is when I'm at work or when I'm editing these videos the rest of the time I want to do things on my phone and I think one of the big advantages of finvest so far is it's so much easier to navigate than treasury direct or your brokerage website as I've mentioned in previous videos I use t- bills as a backup to my emergency Savings in a high yield savings account so I went and connected that savings account to finvest so anytime I want to move money from my savings into back up into t- bills I can do it quickly with just a few Taps on my phone I actually moved $1,000 over the other day that I want to put into a 4-we t- bill so I figured I'd give you a demonstration on how finvest works so here we go you can see I've got $1,000 cash in my in my finvest portfolio here I just click on invest it shows me each T Bill maturity length and what they're currently yielding I just pick the one I want which is the one month treasury bill at 5.35% right now I enter in how much I want to invest at that which of course course is my 4,000 I have there right now I click confirm and boom I just bought $1,000 worth of 4we T bills just like that and of course I'll leave a link to this finvest app down in the description of the video if you want to check them out go ahead and do that now a thing you have to remember t- Bells don't pay interest like a stock pays dividends or your bank pays you interest on your savings account instead when you buy the t- bill like I just did there you buy it at a discount which represents the amount of Interest you're going to earn when the t- bill matures so even though I just told Finn I want to buy $1,000 worth of 4-we T bills I'll only actually pay $990 some dollars for it right now I screwed up the math on that in one of my last t- bill videos and I can't even count how many comments I got correcting me about it so thank you for paying attention and being much better at math than me but once the t- bill matures that's when I get the full th000 so however much you enter that you want to buy in t bills whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $110,000 that's the amount you'll receive at maturity what you'll pay at the time of purchase is that amount less whatever interest you're going to earn t- bills aren't the only major opportunity we have right now when it comes to places we can park our cash ibonds while severely less hyped than they were a year or two ago are actually a much better investment opportunity right now than they were a year or so ago when they were paying like 99.6% interest that's because back when they were paying that 9% interest the entire interest rate that ibon was paying was the variable in inflation interest rate remember an ion's total interest rate is made up of a variable portion that changes with inflation and a fixed portion so you got a huge interest rate for 6 months because inflation was so high but as inflation has slowed the variable interest rate that ibonds pay has come down with it but like we just discussed with t- bills interest rates in general are so high right now ibonds are now paying a 1.3% fixed interest rate that is good for the life of the bond so that means even though when you go and look up the ibond interest rate right now it says they're paying 5.27 % obviously far lower than their peak of 99.62% a little over a year ago but they're actually a far more attractive option right now if you're playing on holding long term because any ibonds you buy right now through the end of April will beat inflation by 1.3% for as long as you hold the bond or 30 years whatever goes first and before you ask the answer is yes if you bought ibonds back a year or two ago when they were yielding 79% but the entire interest rate was the variable rate I do think it is a good idea to sell those I funds and Reby the new ones that carry the 1.3% fixed interest rate as long as you're planning on holding them for the long term it's worth taking that hit and paying the 3-month interest penalty to get out of the ones with no fixed interest rate into the ones at 1.3% fixed my plan is to completely max out my ibond allotment for 2024 I've already purchased $5,000 worth and I told the IRS I want my full tax refund coming to me in the form of ibond remember that lets you buy another $5,000 worth above and beyond the $110,000 limit for the other $55,000 though I'm going to wait until early to mid April to decide if I want to Max them all out now or wait until after April 30th in the event that that fixed interest rate ibonds are paying increases for the bonds that will be issued between May and October of 2024 because that fixed interest rate above and beyond the inflation rate will be a real benefit to my savings goals like paying for kids college someday because ibonds become even more attractive when used for educ a costs if you want to know more about that and several other unique ways you can use ibonds that you may not have thought about before be sure to click on this video now thanks for watching and I hope to see you there","Despite roaring equity and crypto markets, a financial analyst asserts that 2024 remains an excellent time to invest in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and I-Bonds, as they provide essential portfolio safety, inflation protection, and the opportunity to lock in high interest rates before potential future declines.

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are highlighted for their safety (U.S. government-backed, guaranteeing principal if held to maturity), attractive state tax-exempt yields (currently over 5.3% for shorter terms like 4-week, surpassing high-yield savings accounts), and the ability to lock in these potentially peaking rates. The speaker uses shorter-term T-Bills for liquidity, advising investors to align maturities with their cash needs, and recommends Finvest as an easy-to-use platform for purchases.

**I-Bonds** are now considered a ""much better investment opportunity"" for long-term holders due to a new, guaranteed 1.3% fixed interest rate, which ensures they will beat inflation for up to 30 years. This contrasts with previous I-Bonds that had a 0% fixed rate. The analyst advises strategically selling older 0% fixed-rate I-Bonds to repurchase new ones, even if it incurs a 3-month interest penalty. He plans to maximize his 2024 I-Bond allotment ($10,000 direct purchase + $5,000 via tax refund), delaying the tax refund portion until mid-April to potentially secure an even higher fixed rate for I-Bonds issued from May to October, noting their particular suitability for future expenses like education.",New York State,0.7,-0.3

#tbills #treasurybills #ibonds #getfinvest #personalfinance","Kind: captions Language: en inflation has slowed interest rates are peaking and you're wondering should I still be putting my money towards treasury bills and ibonds in this video I'll give you the answer to that question and let you in on my personal strategy for how much I'll be investing in t- bills and ibonds this year the draw to T bills over the past few years has been easy to explain there was a lot of instability and fear surrounding the economy and unlike stocks treasuries are completely safe investment backed by the full faith of the US government so as long as you hold your treasuries until maturity you're guaranteed not to lose any of the principle you put into them in the first place and investors have been craving that kind of safety the fact that t- bills have been paying record high interest rates on top of that only made them that much more appealing even now t- bells are yielding over 5.3% that's higher than even the best high yield savings accounts you'll find but we're in a different Market than we were in 2023 or 2022 stocks are soaring Bitcoin is at alltime highs and it generally feels like good times are here again so should you be putting your money into t- bills and locking in 5% when you could be buying a ticket to the moon and dumping that money into Bitcoin or Nvidia it's a legitimate question to ask yourself and I'll give you a few reasons why I think that t- bills and ibonds are still worth your time in 2024 as I sit here and record this we're in the middle of tax season I just filed my return last week and while it was nice earning a nice high interest rate on my savings account all year long it became a little less fun when I filed my taxes because as some of you may know I live in New York and any of that interest I earned on my high yield savings account over the course of the year is taxed not only by the federal government but by New York State as well and chances are you're in the same boat as I am because 41 out of the 50 states have a state income tax but if you invest that money in t- bills not only do you get a higher interest rate than high yield savings accounts are paying but any interest you earn on treasuries is exempt from state income taxes meaning the actual interest rate you're earning by putting your money in the treasuries is in reality that much higher than what you're earning on your high yield savings account and no matter who we are each one of us still has a need for safety in our portfolio Safety Not only from loss but from inflation and from changing interest rates because interest rates right now are the highest they've been at since around 2007 and all signs are pointing to this maybe being the highest they're going to get for a while the possibility is they may even decrease in the near future and I think that opens up a unique opportunity not only in TB bills but also with ibonds which we'll talk

rate than the oneyear t bills but remember and I have to point this out because I got a lot of comments on my prior t- Bill videos the interest rates quoted for t- bills are the annual ized interest rate so a 4-we t bill paying 5.3% you're not getting 5.3% in that 4 weeks you're getting 4 weeks of an annualized 5.3% interest on your money so just don't let that trip you up and you'll be fine another thing I got a lot of comments about in my prior t- Bill videos which you should watch if you haven't is that using the treasury direct website to buy them is really clunky and not user friendly so that's why I'm also trying out a new app made specifically for buying treasury bills with it's called finvest and lets me buy t- bills straight from the app on my phone the only time I'm ever on an actual computer is when I'm at work or when I'm editing these videos the rest of the time I want to do things on my phone and I think one of the big advantages of finvest so far is it's so much easier to navigate than treasury direct or your brokerage website as I've mentioned in previous videos I use t- bills as a backup to my emergency Savings in a high yield savings account so I went and connected that savings account to finvest so anytime I want to move money from my savings into back up into t- bills I can do it quickly with just a few Taps on my phone I actually moved $1,000 over the other day that I want to put into a 4-we t- bill so I figured I'd give you a demonstration on how finvest works so here we go you can see I've got $1,000 cash in my in my finvest portfolio here I just click on invest it shows me each T Bill maturity length and what they're currently yielding I just pick the one I want which is the one month treasury bill at 5.35% right now I enter in how much I want to invest at that which of course course is my 4,000 I have there right now I click confirm and boom I just bought $1,000 worth of 4we T bills just like that and of course I'll leave a link to this finvest app down in the description of the video if you want to check them out go ahead and do that now a thing you have to remember t- Bells don't pay interest like a stock pays dividends or your bank pays you interest on your savings account instead when you buy the t- bill like I just did there you buy it at a discount which represents the amount of Interest you're going to earn when the t- bill matures so even though I just told Finn I want to buy $1,000 worth of 4-we T bills I'll only actually pay $990 some dollars for it right now I screwed up the math on that in one of my last t- bill videos and I can't even count how many comments I got correcting me about it so thank you for paying attention and being much better at math than me but once the t- bill matures that's when I get the full th000 so however much you enter that you want to buy in t bills whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $110,000 that's the amount you'll receive at maturity what you'll pay at the time of purchase is that amount less whatever interest you're going to earn t- bills aren't the only major opportunity we have right now when it comes to places we can park our cash ibonds while severely less hyped than they were a year or two ago are actually a much better investment opportunity right now than they were a year or so ago when they were paying like 99.6% interest that's because back when they were paying that 9% interest the entire interest rate that ibon was paying was the variable in inflation interest rate remember an ion's total interest rate is made up of a variable portion that changes with inflation and a fixed portion so you got a huge interest rate for 6 months because inflation was so high but as inflation has slowed the variable interest rate that ibonds pay has come down with it but like we just discussed with t- bills interest rates in general are so high right now ibonds are now paying a 1.3% fixed interest rate that is good for the life of the bond so that means even though when you go and look up the ibond interest rate right now it says they're paying 5.27 % obviously far lower than their peak of 99.62% a little over a year ago but they're actually a far more attractive option right now if you're playing on holding long term because any ibonds you buy right now through the end of April will beat inflation by 1.3% for as long as you hold the bond or 30 years whatever goes first and before you ask the answer is yes if you bought ibonds back a year or two ago when they were yielding 79% but the entire interest rate was the variable rate I do think it is a good idea to sell those I funds and Reby the new ones that carry the 1.3% fixed interest rate as long as you're planning on holding them for the long term it's worth taking that hit and paying the 3-month interest penalty to get out of the ones with no fixed interest rate into the ones at 1.3% fixed my plan is to completely max out my ibond allotment for 2024 I've already purchased $5,000 worth and I told the IRS I want my full tax refund coming to me in the form of ibond remember that lets you buy another $5,000 worth above and beyond the $110,000 limit for the other $55,000 though I'm going to wait until early to mid April to decide if I want to Max them all out now or wait until after April 30th in the event that that fixed interest rate ibonds are paying increases for the bonds that will be issued between May and October of 2024 because that fixed interest rate above and beyond the inflation rate will be a real benefit to my savings goals like paying for kids college someday because ibonds become even more attractive when used for educ a costs if you want to know more about that and several other unique ways you can use ibonds that you may not have thought about before be sure to click on this video now thanks for watching and I hope to see you there","Despite roaring equity and crypto markets, a financial analyst asserts that 2024 remains an excellent time to invest in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and I-Bonds, as they provide essential portfolio safety, inflation protection, and the opportunity to lock in high interest rates before potential future declines.

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are highlighted for their safety (U.S. government-backed, guaranteeing principal if held to maturity), attractive state tax-exempt yields (currently over 5.3% for shorter terms like 4-week, surpassing high-yield savings accounts), and the ability to lock in these potentially peaking rates. The speaker uses shorter-term T-Bills for liquidity, advising investors to align maturities with their cash needs, and recommends Finvest as an easy-to-use platform for purchases.

**I-Bonds** are now considered a ""much better investment opportunity"" for long-term holders due to a new, guaranteed 1.3% fixed interest rate, which ensures they will beat inflation for up to 30 years. This contrasts with previous I-Bonds that had a 0% fixed rate. The analyst advises strategically selling older 0% fixed-rate I-Bonds to repurchase new ones, even if it incurs a 3-month interest penalty. He plans to maximize his 2024 I-Bond allotment ($10,000 direct purchase + $5,000 via tax refund), delaying the tax refund portion until mid-April to potentially secure an even higher fixed rate for I-Bonds issued from May to October, noting their particular suitability for future expenses like education.",Finvest,1.0,0.9

#tbills #treasurybills #ibonds #getfinvest #personalfinance","Kind: captions Language: en inflation has slowed interest rates are peaking and you're wondering should I still be putting my money towards treasury bills and ibonds in this video I'll give you the answer to that question and let you in on my personal strategy for how much I'll be investing in t- bills and ibonds this year the draw to T bills over the past few years has been easy to explain there was a lot of instability and fear surrounding the economy and unlike stocks treasuries are completely safe investment backed by the full faith of the US government so as long as you hold your treasuries until maturity you're guaranteed not to lose any of the principle you put into them in the first place and investors have been craving that kind of safety the fact that t- bills have been paying record high interest rates on top of that only made them that much more appealing even now t- bells are yielding over 5.3% that's higher than even the best high yield savings accounts you'll find but we're in a different Market than we were in 2023 or 2022 stocks are soaring Bitcoin is at alltime highs and it generally feels like good times are here again so should you be putting your money into t- bills and locking in 5% when you could be buying a ticket to the moon and dumping that money into Bitcoin or Nvidia it's a legitimate question to ask yourself and I'll give you a few reasons why I think that t- bills and ibonds are still worth your time in 2024 as I sit here and record this we're in the middle of tax season I just filed my return last week and while it was nice earning a nice high interest rate on my savings account all year long it became a little less fun when I filed my taxes because as some of you may know I live in New York and any of that interest I earned on my high yield savings account over the course of the year is taxed not only by the federal government but by New York State as well and chances are you're in the same boat as I am because 41 out of the 50 states have a state income tax but if you invest that money in t- bills not only do you get a higher interest rate than high yield savings accounts are paying but any interest you earn on treasuries is exempt from state income taxes meaning the actual interest rate you're earning by putting your money in the treasuries is in reality that much higher than what you're earning on your high yield savings account and no matter who we are each one of us still has a need for safety in our portfolio Safety Not only from loss but from inflation and from changing interest rates because interest rates right now are the highest they've been at since around 2007 and all signs are pointing to this maybe being the highest they're going to get for a while the possibility is they may even decrease in the near future and I think that opens up a unique opportunity not only in TB bills but also with ibonds which we'll talk more about in a minute the opportunity we have in t- bills right now is that if this really is the highest interest rates are going to get for a long time we can lock them in right now and protect ourselves against the possibility of them falling over the course of this year because once you buy a t bill you lock in that interest rate that's what you're going to earn on that investment no matter what it's not like your high yield savings account where the second that the FED Cuts interest rates your bank is going to follow suit and cut the interest rate they're paying you on your money and the longer term T bill you buy buy better off you'll be if and when the FED does decide to start cutting interest rates later this year or maybe even in the next a one-year T bill is currently paying right around 5% so you can lock in a guaranteed 5% and no risk return on your money by buying a 12-month T bill when the probability is that a year from now interest rates are going to be significantly lower than 5% my only word of caution here is to be sure you weigh the length of T Bill you're going to buy against when you may need access to that money because while you can sell t- bills early before maturity I always advise buying a length that you'll be comfortable with holding the whole way through we should also be a little careful on playing predictions on where interest rates might go if they might go higher or lower in the future because that just like timing the stock market is a game none of us are going to win now in my case my wife is in the market for a new car so we're going to have to pull a good chunk of money out of our savings to pay for it whenever she makes up her mind and decides what is is she wants to drive so I'm going to need to have access us some money fairly quickly and I don't want to lock that money up in a one-year T Bill if I'm going to need it in 2 or 3 months so instead what I'm doing with my T Bill Investments right now is I'm

over the other day that I want to put into a 4-we t- bill so I figured I'd give you a demonstration on how finvest works so here we go you can see I've got $1,000 cash in my in my finvest portfolio here I just click on invest it shows me each T Bill maturity length and what they're currently yielding I just pick the one I want which is the one month treasury bill at 5.35% right now I enter in how much I want to invest at that which of course course is my 4,000 I have there right now I click confirm and boom I just bought $1,000 worth of 4we T bills just like that and of course I'll leave a link to this finvest app down in the description of the video if you want to check them out go ahead and do that now a thing you have to remember t- Bells don't pay interest like a stock pays dividends or your bank pays you interest on your savings account instead when you buy the t- bill like I just did there you buy it at a discount which represents the amount of Interest you're going to earn when the t- bill matures so even though I just told Finn I want to buy $1,000 worth of 4-we T bills I'll only actually pay $990 some dollars for it right now I screwed up the math on that in one of my last t- bill videos and I can't even count how many comments I got correcting me about it so thank you for paying attention and being much better at math than me but once the t- bill matures that's when I get the full th000 so however much you enter that you want to buy in t bills whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $110,000 that's the amount you'll receive at maturity what you'll pay at the time of purchase is that amount less whatever interest you're going to earn t- bills aren't the only major opportunity we have right now when it comes to places we can park our cash ibonds while severely less hyped than they were a year or two ago are actually a much better investment opportunity right now than they were a year or so ago when they were paying like 99.6% interest that's because back when they were paying that 9% interest the entire interest rate that ibon was paying was the variable in inflation interest rate remember an ion's total interest rate is made up of a variable portion that changes with inflation and a fixed portion so you got a huge interest rate for 6 months because inflation was so high but as inflation has slowed the variable interest rate that ibonds pay has come down with it but like we just discussed with t- bills interest rates in general are so high right now ibonds are now paying a 1.3% fixed interest rate that is good for the life of the bond so that means even though when you go and look up the ibond interest rate right now it says they're paying 5.27 % obviously far lower than their peak of 99.62% a little over a year ago but they're actually a far more attractive option right now if you're playing on holding long term because any ibonds you buy right now through the end of April will beat inflation by 1.3% for as long as you hold the bond or 30 years whatever goes first and before you ask the answer is yes if you bought ibonds back a year or two ago when they were yielding 79% but the entire interest rate was the variable rate I do think it is a good idea to sell those I funds and Reby the new ones that carry the 1.3% fixed interest rate as long as you're planning on holding them for the long term it's worth taking that hit and paying the 3-month interest penalty to get out of the ones with no fixed interest rate into the ones at 1.3% fixed my plan is to completely max out my ibond allotment for 2024 I've already purchased $5,000 worth and I told the IRS I want my full tax refund coming to me in the form of ibond remember that lets you buy another $5,000 worth above and beyond the $110,000 limit for the other $55,000 though I'm going to wait until early to mid April to decide if I want to Max them all out now or wait until after April 30th in the event that that fixed interest rate ibonds are paying increases for the bonds that will be issued between May and October of 2024 because that fixed interest rate above and beyond the inflation rate will be a real benefit to my savings goals like paying for kids college someday because ibonds become even more attractive when used for educ a costs if you want to know more about that and several other unique ways you can use ibonds that you may not have thought about before be sure to click on this video now thanks for watching and I hope to see you there","Despite roaring equity and crypto markets, a financial analyst asserts that 2024 remains an excellent time to invest in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and I-Bonds, as they provide essential portfolio safety, inflation protection, and the opportunity to lock in high interest rates before potential future declines.

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are highlighted for their safety (U.S. government-backed, guaranteeing principal if held to maturity), attractive state tax-exempt yields (currently over 5.3% for shorter terms like 4-week, surpassing high-yield savings accounts), and the ability to lock in these potentially peaking rates. The speaker uses shorter-term T-Bills for liquidity, advising investors to align maturities with their cash needs, and recommends Finvest as an easy-to-use platform for purchases.

**I-Bonds** are now considered a ""much better investment opportunity"" for long-term holders due to a new, guaranteed 1.3% fixed interest rate, which ensures they will beat inflation for up to 30 years. This contrasts with previous I-Bonds that had a 0% fixed rate. The analyst advises strategically selling older 0% fixed-rate I-Bonds to repurchase new ones, even if it incurs a 3-month interest penalty. He plans to maximize his 2024 I-Bond allotment ($10,000 direct purchase + $5,000 via tax refund), delaying the tax refund portion until mid-April to potentially secure an even higher fixed rate for I-Bonds issued from May to October, noting their particular suitability for future expenses like education.",IRS,0.8,0.0

#M1Finance #brokerage #investingapps","Kind: captions Language: en there have been some really big changes to M1 Finance over the past year with the investment platform checking and savings accounts and the M1 plus feature in this video I'm going to go over everything that's changed and why I think it means M1 Finance has fundamentally changed and whether or not I think you should use M1 Finance in 2024 as always this video is not sponsored by M1 Finance these are my unbiased thoughts as a longtime user because I've been investing my money at and recommending M1 Finance to just about everyone I know for several years now and as a user of M1 I'm happy because I'm happy with the functionality of the platform how m1's piie system of grouping your Investments together lets me take a completely hands-off approach to managing my portfolio I know that with every new dollar I add to my M1 invest portfolio one will take that money and invest it in such a way that keeps my investments allocated just the way I set them without me having to worry about going in and ever rebalancing my portfolio mediately I even made M1 earn and they yield savings account my main savings account it's currently paying 5% interest and that interest gets posted to my account at the end of every monthly Clockwork and transferring money between my different accounts at M1 have into and out of my checking account with a completely separate Bank from my M1 high yield savings account has been completely seamless and honestly any changes I'm going to talk about in the rest of this video don't change that fact at all but that doesn't mean they may not change it for you if you're a current or even a prospective EM1 customer so though let's get dirty there have been a lot of changes with M1 over the past year since I made my last video on them and I'm going to be straight with you they're not all good but the first change I want to talk about is a good one and that was M1 directly addressing a complaint that a lot of users had about ple and that complaint that a lot of people had in the past about M1 was that they used payment for order flow in order to execute their trade meaning all the trades that customers placed on M1 M1 then went and sold all that trading volume to a third party to execute the trades for them and in the past that third party was Apex only now the reality of all this is unless you're a really active day trader it's pretty insignificant in irr but it did gain a lot of notoriety back in the Robin Hood Scandal a few years back and out of all that Robin Hood drama any Brokers using pain for order flow it became kind of a blackmark against it so every1 took a major stat and as of mid 2023 they brought all of their trade execution and clearing in the house meaning no more payment for order flow on M1 Finance another thing that's changed over the past year or two with M1 Finance is that they've expanded their product offerings why aggressively I mean when I first joined that one all they had was the investment platform since then they added checking accounts with a debit card high yield savings account I already mentioned a cash back rewards credit card cryptocurrency accounts and the ability to create smart transfers to transfer money between all of your M1 accounts based on a set of rules that you define as you can imagine any company that expand that much over a relatively short period of time is going to experience some Growing Pains so now let's get into it and talk about some of the changes that have happened over M1 recently that have left customers upset confused and the major change that M1 just made that redefines what they are as a company first though is a feature that came and then went over the summer M1 sent out a notice to all its checking account and debit card customers that they would stop paying interest into the M1 checking accounts by July 1st of 2023 and would be closing the checking account product by Halloween they recommended that customers take the money they had in the checking accounts and move over into the high yield savings account instead and want to claim that the reason for all this was because of the suspension of savings account withdrawal limits back in 2020 then there were just fewer differences between checking accounts and savings accounts anymore but obviously if you were using your M1 checking account as your main checking account this was a huge pain in the yeah not only do you have to move all your money into a different account but then you have to update all the automatic transfers and payments you may have set up and one also said that they would be adding many checking leg features to the high yield savings account I bet time May close down the checking accounts in October of 2023 so as we sit here talking about this in early 2024 how does that all look not good as I already mentioned I'm a user of the M1 high yield savings SC and have been since day one when the product will be and I have seen no checking like features whatever that's supposed to mean added to the account at any point as a high yield savings account it's great I have no complaints but if I was one of the many checking account customers that were told to move my money over into this account and were expecting to use it as I was using the checking account andd be pissed because not only have they not added any of those checking like features to the account in order to satisfy those customers they closed down new account openings to the high yield savings account just a few months after they opened the product to begin with and I am not sure why M1 fans did this I mean it's not like they just sat around in the boardroom and said hey let's offer a checking account in a sa's account and you'll press the button to make it happen they went out and bought a bank in order to provide these services to their customers and then they Clos down the checking accounts all together and pause new signups to the saving accounts for reasons I even email a rep with M1 asking when high yield SARS accounts were're going to reopen to new accounts and I got told it'll be a reopening soon but didn't get any sort of timeline on what soon actually means and it's a shame because I think the high yield savings account works great and it is a really great product to add on if you're already using M1 invest so I'm hoping that when they do reopen the high yield savings account to new customers it will be with those additional features they promised the checking account customers last year but only time to tell not the most recent change the one M1 just made and I think represents a seismic shift in what M1 Finance stands for and who should use it in the first place what many of you don't know is I already made this video and I was halfway through editing that video getting it ready to post when M1 dropped a Bushell on us all and caused me to have to start completely over and make the video you're watching now and that big change not only has to do with M1 Plus plus but the core of the M1 investment product itself when I first signed up for M1 a few years back M1 Plus cost $125 per year and all it really got you was access to their second afternoon trading window as recently as last year the price was the same but they did a lot to add the value you were getting for your money and the original plan for M1 Plus in 2024 was to keep all those same product offerings I just mentioned but the Slash the price of M1 plus down to 3 $6 per year or just $3 per month but now the announcement M1 just made is that starting in May of 2024 all of that is going to change because starting in May all of those M1 plus features I just mentioned will be free and not only that once this change goes into effect M1 will refund you for whatever remaining months of M1 plus you had already paid for great right well not entirely because there's a catch and a lot of current and potential customers going to be happy about it the catch is all those products and services are free if you have at least $10,000 with M1 now that $10,000 doesn't have to be all in the same account if you have $3,000 in your high yield savings account and $7,000 in your Roa you have $10,000 combined with M1 whatever way you get $110,000 combined it counts and if you don't have at least $10,000 with M1 you're not going to be happy because they're going to start charging a $3 a month platform fee just to have your account on the platform with under 10 grand in it one of the main selling points of M1 and one of the reasons I've always recommended it so highly is because the main investing product is really perfect for a passive investment strategy built around dollar cost averages you're the kind of person that wants to slowly build your portfolio over time through consistent deposits of new money M1 was purpose built and perfect for that and they did for free but now they've change that and it's making me really think about who M1 Finance is best for and whether or not I should still recommend it to you I think one of the reasons M1 is doing all this is because a it's probably pretty expensive to hold and maintain all of these small accounts that have under $10,000 in them and B the $3 a month fee they're going to start charging people with less than $10,000 in their accounts is still less than just about all of the comparable services that M1 probably considers direct competitive s to their products things like acorns or wel front or m1's new fitfolio products I think all those products which are M1 competitors are around $5 a month so everyone is probably thinking we're still cheaper than all of our competitors and we have all these other products combined not just the automated investing portion of it so would I still recommend M1 Finance to you in 2024 think if you're a current or prospective user that has more than $10,000 you're going to invest there absolutely 100% if you don't immediately have $10,000 you're going to put in there but you think you can get to that level in the relatively short term then yes I still think using M1 is a great idea but if you're someone who's going to start off with a very small amount and slowly build over time say you're going to deposit $100 and you only have $50 or $100 a month to add to that that's where the value proposition gets a little tricky because yes some of the automation features and the pies and all that of M1 are great features which I do think will help you out and if that's was really drawing you to M1 in the first place then yeah it is still cheaper than other companies that have those similar features but on the other hand there are also plenty of places where you can invest small amounts of money completely for free it's really up to you to decide is $3 a month worth it for these automation features that M1 has or am I better off going to a fidelity awab or even a Robin Hood whether or not you decide to invest to M1 Finance or somewhere else is up to you I think you should check out this video next on these six best index funds that you can use to build your portfolio around thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoy that one and I'll see you next time","M1 Finance has undergone significant changes, fundamentally altering its value proposition. Key positive shifts include the elimination of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) by bringing trade execution in-house and making all M1 Plus features (such as multiple trading windows) free for users.

However, these improvements are coupled with challenges and a new fee structure. M1 discontinued its checking accounts and temporarily paused new high-yield savings account (HYSA) enrollments, failing to deliver promised ""checking-like"" features to the HYSA. Most notably, effective May 2024, a new $3/month platform fee will be introduced for accounts with a total combined balance under $10,000, effectively making M1 Plus features free only for those above this threshold. This fee is speculated to manage the cost of small accounts and maintain competitiveness.

As a result, M1 Finance is highly recommended for users who already have or can quickly accumulate $10,000 or more to invest, as its automated ""pie"" system for hands-off dollar-cost averaging remains excellent and the platform effectively becomes free for them. For investors starting with smaller amounts (e.g., under $10,000), the $3/month fee makes the value proposition ""tricky."" While M1's automation is valuable, the fee may erode returns for small balances, and free alternatives like Fidelity, Schwab, or Robinhood might be more suitable unless the user highly values M1's specific automation features.",M1 Finance,1.0,-0.2

absolutely 100% if you don't immediately have $10,000 you're going to put in there but you think you can get to that level in the relatively short term then yes I still think using M1 is a great idea but if you're someone who's going to start off with a very small amount and slowly build over time say you're going to deposit $100 and you only have $50 or $100 a month to add to that that's where the value proposition gets a little tricky because yes some of the automation features and the pies and all that of M1 are great features which I do think will help you out and if that's was really drawing you to M1 in the first place then yeah it is still cheaper than other companies that have those similar features but on the other hand there are also plenty of places where you can invest small amounts of money completely for free it's really up to you to decide is $3 a month worth it for these automation features that M1 has or am I better off going to a fidelity awab or even a Robin Hood whether or not you decide to invest to M1 Finance or somewhere else is up to you I think you should check out this video next on these six best index funds that you can use to build your portfolio around thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoy that one and I'll see you next time","M1 Finance has undergone significant changes, fundamentally altering its value proposition. Key positive shifts include the elimination of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) by bringing trade execution in-house and making all M1 Plus features (such as multiple trading windows) free for users.

However, these improvements are coupled with challenges and a new fee structure. M1 discontinued its checking accounts and temporarily paused new high-yield savings account (HYSA) enrollments, failing to deliver promised ""checking-like"" features to the HYSA. Most notably, effective May 2024, a new $3/month platform fee will be introduced for accounts with a total combined balance under $10,000, effectively making M1 Plus features free only for those above this threshold. This fee is speculated to manage the cost of small accounts and maintain competitiveness.

As a result, M1 Finance is highly recommended for users who already have or can quickly accumulate $10,000 or more to invest, as its automated ""pie"" system for hands-off dollar-cost averaging remains excellent and the platform effectively becomes free for them. For investors starting with smaller amounts (e.g., under $10,000), the $3/month fee makes the value proposition ""tricky."" While M1's automation is valuable, the fee may erode returns for small balances, and free alternatives like Fidelity, Schwab, or Robinhood might be more suitable unless the user highly values M1's specific automation features.",Apex,0.9,0.0

#M1Finance #brokerage #investingapps","Kind: captions Language: en there have been some really big changes to M1 Finance over the past year with the investment platform checking and savings accounts and the M1 plus feature in this video I'm going to go over everything that's changed and why I think it means M1 Finance has fundamentally changed and whether or not I think you should use M1 Finance in 2024 as always this video is not sponsored by M1 Finance these are my unbiased thoughts as a longtime user because I've been investing my money at and recommending M1 Finance to just about everyone I know for several years now and as a user of M1 I'm happy because I'm happy with the functionality of the platform how m1's piie system of grouping your Investments together lets me take a completely hands-off approach to managing my portfolio I know that with every new dollar I add to my M1 invest portfolio one will take that money and invest it in such a way that keeps my investments allocated just the way I set them without me having to worry about going in and ever rebalancing my portfolio mediately I even made M1 earn and they yield savings account my main savings account it's currently paying 5% interest and that interest gets posted to my account at the end of every monthly Clockwork and transferring money between my different accounts at M1 have into and out of my checking account with a completely separate Bank from my M1 high yield savings account has been completely seamless and honestly any changes I'm going to talk about in the rest of this video don't change that fact at all but that doesn't mean they may not change it for you if you're a current or even a prospective EM1 customer so though let's get dirty there have been a lot of changes with M1 over the past year since I made my last video on them and I'm going to be straight with you they're not all good but the first change I want to talk about is a good one and that was M1 directly addressing a complaint that a lot of users had about ple and that complaint that a lot of people had in the past about M1 was that they used payment for order flow in order to execute their trade meaning all the trades that customers placed on M1 M1 then went and sold all that trading volume to a third party to execute the trades for them and in the past that third party was Apex only now the reality of all this is unless you're a really active day trader it's pretty insignificant in irr but it did gain a lot of notoriety back in the Robin Hood Scandal a few years back and out of all that Robin Hood drama any Brokers using pain for order flow it became kind of a blackmark against it so every1 took a major stat and as of mid 2023 they brought all of their trade execution and clearing in the house meaning no more payment for order flow on M1 Finance another thing that's changed over the past year or two with M1 Finance is that they've expanded their product offerings why aggressively I mean when I first joined that one all they had was the investment platform since then they added checking accounts with a debit card high yield savings account I already mentioned a cash back rewards credit card cryptocurrency accounts and the ability to create smart transfers to transfer money between all of your M1 accounts based on a set of rules that you define as you can imagine any company that expand that much over a relatively short period of time is going to experience some Growing Pains so now let's get into it and talk about some of the changes that have happened over M1 recently that have left customers upset confused and the major change that M1 just made that redefines what they are as a company first though is a feature that came and then went over the summer M1 sent out a notice to all its checking account and debit card customers that they would stop paying interest into the M1 checking accounts by July 1st of 2023 and would be closing the checking account product by Halloween they recommended that customers take the money they had in the checking accounts and move over into the high yield savings account instead and want to claim that the reason for all this was because of the suspension of savings account withdrawal limits back in 2020 then there were just fewer differences between checking accounts and savings accounts anymore but obviously if you were using your M1 checking account as your main checking account this was a huge pain in the yeah not only do you have to move all your money into a different account but then you have to update all the automatic transfers and payments you may have set up and one also said that they would be adding many checking leg features to the high yield savings account I bet time May close down the checking accounts in October of 2023 so as we sit here talking about this in early 2024 how does that all look not good as I already mentioned I'm a user of the M1 high yield savings SC and have been since day one when the product will be and I have seen no checking like features whatever that's supposed to mean added to the account at any point as a high yield savings account it's great I have no complaints but if I was one of the many checking account customers that were told to move my money over into this account and were expecting to use it as I was using the checking account andd be pissed because not only have they not added any of those checking like features to the account in order to satisfy those customers they closed down new account openings to the high yield savings account just a few months after they opened the product to begin with and I am not sure why M1 fans did this I mean it's not like they just sat around in the boardroom and said hey let's offer a checking account in a sa's account and you'll press the button to make it happen they went out and bought a bank in order to provide these services to their customers and then they Clos down the checking accounts all together and pause new signups to the saving accounts for reasons I even email a rep with M1 asking when high yield SARS accounts were're going to reopen to new accounts and I got told it'll be a reopening soon but didn't get any sort of timeline on what soon actually means and it's a shame because I think the high yield savings account works great and it is a really great product to add on if you're already using M1 invest so I'm hoping that when they do reopen the high yield savings account to new customers it will be with those additional features they promised the checking account customers last year but only time to tell not the most recent change the one M1 just made and I think represents a seismic shift in what M1 Finance stands for and who should use it in the first place what many of you don't know is I already made this video and I was halfway through editing that video getting it ready to post when M1 dropped a Bushell on us all and caused me to have to start completely over and make the video you're watching now and that big change not only has to do with M1 Plus plus but the core of the M1 investment product itself when I first signed up for M1 a few years back M1 Plus cost $125 per year and all it really got you was access to their second afternoon trading window as recently as last year the price was the same but they did a lot to add the value you were getting for your money and the original plan for M1 Plus in 2024 was to keep all those same product offerings I just mentioned but the Slash the price of M1 plus down to 3 $6 per year or just $3 per month but now the announcement M1 just made is that starting in May of 2024 all of that is going to change because starting in May all of those M1 plus features I just mentioned will be free and not only that once this change goes into effect M1 will refund you for whatever remaining months of M1 plus you had already paid for great right well not entirely because there's a catch and a lot of current and potential customers going to be happy about it the catch is all those products and services are free if you have at least $10,000 with M1 now that $10,000 doesn't have to be all in the same account if you have $3,000 in your high yield savings account and $7,000 in your Roa you have $10,000 combined with M1 whatever way you get $110,000 combined it counts and if you don't have at least $10,000 with M1 you're not going to be happy because they're going to start charging a $3 a month platform fee just to have your account on the platform with under 10 grand in it one of the main selling points of M1 and one of the reasons I've always recommended it so highly is because the main investing product is really perfect for a passive investment strategy built around dollar cost averages you're the kind of person that wants to slowly build your portfolio over time through consistent deposits of new money M1 was purpose built and perfect for that and they did for free but now they've change that and it's making me really think about who M1 Finance is best for and whether or not I should still recommend it to you I think one of the reasons M1 is doing all this is because a it's probably pretty expensive to hold and maintain all of these small accounts that have under $10,000 in them and B the $3 a month fee they're going to start charging people with less than $10,000 in their accounts is still less than just about all of the comparable services that M1 probably considers direct competitive s to their products things like acorns or wel front or m1's new fitfolio products I think all those products which are M1 competitors are around $5 a month so everyone is probably thinking we're still cheaper than all of our competitors and we have all these other products combined not just the automated investing portion of it so would I still recommend M1 Finance to you in 2024 think if you're a current or prospective user that has more than $10,000 you're going to invest there

#M1Finance #brokerage #investingapps","Kind: captions Language: en there have been some really big changes to M1 Finance over the past year with the investment platform checking and savings accounts and the M1 plus feature in this video I'm going to go over everything that's changed and why I think it means M1 Finance has fundamentally changed and whether or not I think you should use M1 Finance in 2024 as always this video is not sponsored by M1 Finance these are my unbiased thoughts as a longtime user because I've been investing my money at and recommending M1 Finance to just about everyone I know for several years now and as a user of M1 I'm happy because I'm happy with the functionality of the platform how m1's piie system of grouping your Investments together lets me take a completely hands-off approach to managing my portfolio I know that with every new dollar I add to my M1 invest portfolio one will take that money and invest it in such a way that keeps my investments allocated just the way I set them without me having to worry about going in and ever rebalancing my portfolio mediately I even made M1 earn and they yield savings account my main savings account it's currently paying 5% interest and that interest gets posted to my account at the end of every monthly Clockwork and transferring money between my different accounts at M1 have into and out of my checking account with a completely separate Bank from my M1 high yield savings account has been completely seamless and honestly any changes I'm going to talk about in the rest of this video don't change that fact at all but that doesn't mean they may not change it for you if you're a current or even a prospective EM1 customer so though let's get dirty there have been a lot of changes with M1 over the past year since I made my last video on them and I'm going to be straight with you they're not all good but the first change I want to talk about is a good one and that was M1 directly addressing a complaint that a lot of users had about ple and that complaint that a lot of people had in the past about M1 was that they used payment for order flow in order to execute their trade meaning all the trades that customers placed on M1 M1 then went and sold all that trading volume to a third party to execute the trades for them and in the past that third party was Apex only now the reality of all this is unless you're a really active day trader it's pretty insignificant in irr but it did gain a lot of notoriety back in the Robin Hood Scandal a few years back and out of all that Robin Hood drama any Brokers using pain for order flow it became kind of a blackmark against it so every1 took a major stat and as of mid 2023 they brought all of their trade execution and clearing in the house meaning no more payment for order flow on M1 Finance another thing that's changed over the past year or two with M1 Finance is that they've expanded their product offerings why aggressively I mean when I first joined that one all they had was the investment platform since then they added checking accounts with a debit card high yield savings account I already mentioned a cash back rewards credit card cryptocurrency accounts and the ability to create smart transfers to transfer money between all of your M1 accounts based on a set of rules that you define as you can imagine any company that expand that much over a relatively short period of time is going to experience some Growing Pains so now let's get into it and talk about some of the changes that have happened over M1 recently that have left customers upset confused and the major change that M1 just made that redefines what they are as a company first though is a feature that came and then went over the summer M1 sent out a notice to all its checking account and debit card customers that they would stop paying interest into the M1 checking accounts by July 1st of 2023 and would be closing the checking account product by Halloween they recommended that customers take the money they had in the checking accounts and move over into the high yield savings account instead and want to claim that the reason for all this was because of the suspension of savings account withdrawal limits back in 2020 then there were just fewer differences between checking accounts and savings accounts anymore but obviously if you were using your M1 checking account as your main checking account this was a huge pain in the yeah not only do you have to move all your money into a different account but then you have to update all the automatic transfers and payments you may have set up and one also said that they would be adding many checking leg features to the high yield savings account I bet time May close down the checking accounts in October of 2023 so as we sit here talking about this in early 2024 how does that all look not good as I already mentioned I'm a user of the M1 high yield savings SC and have been since day one when the product will be and I have seen no checking like features whatever that's supposed to mean added to the account at any point as a high yield savings account it's great I have no complaints but if I was one of the many checking account customers that were told to move my money over into this account and were expecting to use it as I was using the checking account andd be pissed because not only have they not added any of those checking like features to the account in order to satisfy those customers they closed down new account openings to the high yield savings account just a few months after they opened the product to begin with and I am not sure why M1 fans did this I mean it's not like they just sat around in the boardroom and said hey let's offer a checking account in a sa's account and you'll press the button to make it happen they went out and bought a bank in order to provide these services to their customers and then they Clos down the checking accounts all together and pause new signups to the saving accounts for reasons I even email a rep with M1 asking when high yield SARS accounts were're going to reopen to new accounts and I got told it'll be a reopening soon but didn't get any sort of timeline on what soon actually means and it's a shame because I think the high yield savings account works great and it is a really great product to add on if you're already using M1 invest so I'm hoping that when they do reopen the high yield savings account to new customers it will be with those additional features they promised the checking account customers last year but only time to tell not the most recent change the one M1 just made and I think represents a seismic shift in what M1 Finance stands for and who should use it in the first place what many of you don't know is I already made this video and I was halfway through editing that video getting it ready to post when M1 dropped a Bushell on us all and caused me to have to start completely over and make the video you're watching now and that big change not only has to do with M1 Plus plus but the core of the M1 investment product itself when I first signed up for M1 a few years back M1 Plus cost $125 per year and all it really got you was access to their second afternoon trading window as recently as last year the price was the same but they did a lot to add the value you were getting for your money and the original plan for M1 Plus in 2024 was to keep all those same product offerings I just mentioned but the Slash the price of M1 plus down to 3 $6 per year or just $3 per month but now the announcement M1 just made is that starting in May of 2024 all of that is going to change because starting in May all of those M1 plus features I just mentioned will be free and not only that once this change goes into effect M1 will refund you for whatever remaining months of M1 plus you had already paid for great right well not entirely because there's a catch and a lot of current and potential customers going to be happy about it the catch is all those products and services are free if you have at least $10,000 with M1 now that $10,000 doesn't have to be all in the same account if you have $3,000 in your high yield savings account and $7,000 in your Roa you have $10,000 combined with M1 whatever way you get $110,000 combined it counts and if you don't have at least $10,000 with M1 you're not going to be happy because they're going to start charging a $3 a month platform fee just to have your account on the platform with under 10 grand in it one of the main selling points of M1 and one of the reasons I've always recommended it so highly is because the main investing product is really perfect for a passive investment strategy built around dollar cost averages you're the kind of person that wants to slowly build your portfolio over time through consistent deposits of new money M1 was purpose built and perfect for that and they did for free but now they've change that and it's making me really think about who M1 Finance is best for and whether or not I should still recommend it to you I think one of the reasons M1 is doing all this is because a it's probably pretty expensive to hold and maintain all of these small accounts that have under $10,000 in them and B the $3 a month fee they're going to start charging people with less than $10,000 in their accounts is still less than just about all of the comparable services that M1 probably considers direct competitive s to their products things like acorns or wel front or m1's new fitfolio products I think all those products which are M1 competitors are around $5 a month so everyone is probably thinking we're still cheaper than all of our competitors and we have all these other products combined not just the automated investing portion of it so would I still recommend M1 Finance to you in 2024 think if you're a current or prospective user that has more than $10,000 you're going to invest there absolutely 100% if you don't immediately have $10,000 you're going to put in there but you think you can get to that level in the relatively short term then yes I still think using M1 is a great idea but if you're someone who's going to start off with a very small amount and slowly build over time say you're going to deposit $100 and you only have $50 or $100 a month to add to that that's where the value proposition gets a little tricky because yes some of the automation features and the pies and all that of M1 are great features which I do think will help you out and if that's was really drawing you to M1 in the first place then yeah it is still cheaper than other companies that have those similar features but on the other hand there are also plenty of places where you can invest small amounts of money completely for free it's really up to you to decide is $3 a month worth it for these automation features that M1 has or am I better off going to a fidelity awab or even a Robin Hood whether or not you decide to invest to M1 Finance or somewhere else is up to you I think you should check out this video next on these six best index funds that you can use to build your portfolio around thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoy that one and I'll see you next time","M1 Finance has undergone significant changes, fundamentally altering its value proposition. Key positive shifts include the elimination of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) by bringing trade execution in-house and making all M1 Plus features (such as multiple trading windows) free for users.

However, these improvements are coupled with challenges and a new fee structure. M1 discontinued its checking accounts and temporarily paused new high-yield savings account (HYSA) enrollments, failing to deliver promised ""checking-like"" features to the HYSA. Most notably, effective May 2024, a new $3/month platform fee will be introduced for accounts with a total combined balance under $10,000, effectively making M1 Plus features free only for those above this threshold. This fee is speculated to manage the cost of small accounts and maintain competitiveness.

As a result, M1 Finance is highly recommended for users who already have or can quickly accumulate $10,000 or more to invest, as its automated ""pie"" system for hands-off dollar-cost averaging remains excellent and the platform effectively becomes free for them. For investors starting with smaller amounts (e.g., under $10,000), the $3/month fee makes the value proposition ""tricky."" While M1's automation is valuable, the fee may erode returns for small balances, and free alternatives like Fidelity, Schwab, or Robinhood might be more suitable unless the user highly values M1's specific automation features.",Wealthfront,0.9,0.0

that a lot of users had about ple and that complaint that a lot of people had in the past about M1 was that they used payment for order flow in order to execute their trade meaning all the trades that customers placed on M1 M1 then went and sold all that trading volume to a third party to execute the trades for them and in the past that third party was Apex only now the reality of all this is unless you're a really active day trader it's pretty insignificant in irr but it did gain a lot of notoriety back in the Robin Hood Scandal a few years back and out of all that Robin Hood drama any Brokers using pain for order flow it became kind of a blackmark against it so every1 took a major stat and as of mid 2023 they brought all of their trade execution and clearing in the house meaning no more payment for order flow on M1 Finance another thing that's changed over the past year or two with M1 Finance is that they've expanded their product offerings why aggressively I mean when I first joined that one all they had was the investment platform since then they added checking accounts with a debit card high yield savings account I already mentioned a cash back rewards credit card cryptocurrency accounts and the ability to create smart transfers to transfer money between all of your M1 accounts based on a set of rules that you define as you can imagine any company that expand that much over a relatively short period of time is going to experience some Growing Pains so now let's get into it and talk about some of the changes that have happened over M1 recently that have left customers upset confused and the major change that M1 just made that redefines what they are as a company first though is a feature that came and then went over the summer M1 sent out a notice to all its checking account and debit card customers that they would stop paying interest into the M1 checking accounts by July 1st of 2023 and would be closing the checking account product by Halloween they recommended that customers take the money they had in the checking accounts and move over into the high yield savings account instead and want to claim that the reason for all this was because of the suspension of savings account withdrawal limits back in 2020 then there were just fewer differences between checking accounts and savings accounts anymore but obviously if you were using your M1 checking account as your main checking account this was a huge pain in the yeah not only do you have to move all your money into a different account but then you have to update all the automatic transfers and payments you may have set up and one also said that they would be adding many checking leg features to the high yield savings account I bet time May close down the checking accounts in October of 2023 so as we sit here talking about this in early 2024 how does that all look not good as I already mentioned I'm a user of the M1 high yield savings SC and have been since day one when the product will be and I have seen no checking like features whatever that's supposed to mean added to the account at any point as a high yield savings account it's great I have no complaints but if I was one of the many checking account customers that were told to move my money over into this account and were expecting to use it as I was using the checking account andd be pissed because not only have they not added any of those checking like features to the account in order to satisfy those customers they closed down new account openings to the high yield savings account just a few months after they opened the product to begin with and I am not sure why M1 fans did this I mean it's not like they just sat around in the boardroom and said hey let's offer a checking account in a sa's account and you'll press the button to make it happen they went out and bought a bank in order to provide these services to their customers and then they Clos down the checking accounts all together and pause new signups to the saving accounts for reasons I even email a rep with M1 asking when high yield SARS accounts were're going to reopen to new accounts and I got told it'll be a reopening soon but didn't get any sort of timeline on what soon actually means and it's a shame because I think the high yield savings account works great and it is a really great product to add on if you're already using M1 invest so I'm hoping that when they do reopen the high yield savings account to new customers it will be with those additional features they promised the checking account customers last year but only time to tell not the most recent change the one M1 just made and I think represents a seismic shift in what M1 Finance stands for and who should use it in the first place what many of you don't know is I already made this video and I was halfway through editing that video getting it ready to post when M1 dropped a Bushell on us all and caused me to have to start completely over and make the video you're watching now and that big change not only has to do with M1 Plus plus but the core of the M1 investment product itself when I first signed up for M1 a few years back M1 Plus cost $125 per year and all it really got you was access to their second afternoon trading window as recently as last year the price was the same but they did a lot to add the value you were getting for your money and the original plan for M1 Plus in 2024 was to keep all those same product offerings I just mentioned but the Slash the price of M1 plus down to 3 $6 per year or just $3 per month but now the announcement M1 just made is that starting in May of 2024 all of that is going to change because starting in May all of those M1 plus features I just mentioned will be free and not only that once this change goes into effect M1 will refund you for whatever remaining months of M1 plus you had already paid for great right well not entirely because there's a catch and a lot of current and potential customers going to be happy about it the catch is all those products and services are free if you have at least $10,000 with M1 now that $10,000 doesn't have to be all in the same account if you have $3,000 in your high yield savings account and $7,000 in your Roa you have $10,000 combined with M1 whatever way you get $110,000 combined it counts and if you don't have at least $10,000 with M1 you're not going to be happy because they're going to start charging a $3 a month platform fee just to have your account on the platform with under 10 grand in it one of the main selling points of M1 and one of the reasons I've always recommended it so highly is because the main investing product is really perfect for a passive investment strategy built around dollar cost averages you're the kind of person that wants to slowly build your portfolio over time through consistent deposits of new money M1 was purpose built and perfect for that and they did for free but now they've change that and it's making me really think about who M1 Finance is best for and whether or not I should still recommend it to you I think one of the reasons M1 is doing all this is because a it's probably pretty expensive to hold and maintain all of these small accounts that have under $10,000 in them and B the $3 a month fee they're going to start charging people with less than $10,000 in their accounts is still less than just about all of the comparable services that M1 probably considers direct competitive s to their products things like acorns or wel front or m1's new fitfolio products I think all those products which are M1 competitors are around $5 a month so everyone is probably thinking we're still cheaper than all of our competitors and we have all these other products combined not just the automated investing portion of it so would I still recommend M1 Finance to you in 2024 think if you're a current or prospective user that has more than $10,000 you're going to invest there absolutely 100% if you don't immediately have $10,000 you're going to put in there but you think you can get to that level in the relatively short term then yes I still think using M1 is a great idea but if you're someone who's going to start off with a very small amount and slowly build over time say you're going to deposit $100 and you only have $50 or $100 a month to add to that that's where the value proposition gets a little tricky because yes some of the automation features and the pies and all that of M1 are great features which I do think will help you out and if that's was really drawing you to M1 in the first place then yeah it is still cheaper than other companies that have those similar features but on the other hand there are also plenty of places where you can invest small amounts of money completely for free it's really up to you to decide is $3 a month worth it for these automation features that M1 has or am I better off going to a fidelity awab or even a Robin Hood whether or not you decide to invest to M1 Finance or somewhere else is up to you I think you should check out this video next on these six best index funds that you can use to build your portfolio around thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoy that one and I'll see you next time","M1 Finance has undergone significant changes, fundamentally altering its value proposition. Key positive shifts include the elimination of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) by bringing trade execution in-house and making all M1 Plus features (such as multiple trading windows) free for users.

However, these improvements are coupled with challenges and a new fee structure. M1 discontinued its checking accounts and temporarily paused new high-yield savings account (HYSA) enrollments, failing to deliver promised ""checking-like"" features to the HYSA. Most notably, effective May 2024, a new $3/month platform fee will be introduced for accounts with a total combined balance under $10,000, effectively making M1 Plus features free only for those above this threshold. This fee is speculated to manage the cost of small accounts and maintain competitiveness.

As a result, M1 Finance is highly recommended for users who already have or can quickly accumulate $10,000 or more to invest, as its automated ""pie"" system for hands-off dollar-cost averaging remains excellent and the platform effectively becomes free for them. For investors starting with smaller amounts (e.g., under $10,000), the $3/month fee makes the value proposition ""tricky."" While M1's automation is valuable, the fee may erode returns for small balances, and free alternatives like Fidelity, Schwab, or Robinhood might be more suitable unless the user highly values M1's specific automation features.",Schwab,1.0,0.3

#millionaire #stealthwealth #millionaires","Kind: captions Language: en when it comes to becoming a millionaire 90% of people are obsessed with the wrong thing many of us believe that becoming a millionaire is about being able to spend lots of money on a big house fancy cars or a boat but it's not in this video I'll share some shocking statistics about how millionaires spend save and invest that will shatter your preconceived notions about what it means to be a millionaire and why you should really look forward to your 50th birthday becoming a millionaire has been a marker of financial success for longer than any of us have been alive as of this year there are approximately 22 million millionaires in the United States alone naturally any one of us who isn't a millionaire wants to know what it takes to join that club but when most people say I want to be a millionaire what they really mean is I want to spend a million dollars and that's literally the opposite of what it means to become a millionaire as Morgan household so eloquently put it in the psychology of money what's your routine when you go to the grocery store if you're like me you wander around grabbing the things you need and end up buying way too much because you're hungry or you just got tempted by things that looked good well that's not how millionaires shop in fact 85% of millionaires say they use a grocery list and stick to it when they go to the store and 90% say they use coupons not exactly the careless free spending Bunch you may have imagined huh I mean it's one banana Michael what could it cost $10 there's also a stereotype about millionaires they were all born born into money or received a big inheritance from Rich parents or relatives when in reality that couldn't be further from the truth 80% of millionaires have never received any form of inheritance and 80% also grew up in lower class or middle class households but that's got to change as they become adults and become millionaires right if I were to ask you the top professions of millionaires You' probably rattle off a bunch of high-paying jobs like doctor lawyer business owner YouTuber and there are like a large share of millionaires with those high-paying jobs yet onethird of all millionaires have never earned more than $100,000 in a year 44% of all millionaires consider themselves to be middle class which probably makes sense if you consider their judging themselves on the income they're bringing in not necessarily on the entirety of their net worth and if you're sitting there now thinking that becoming a millionaire is Out Of Reach for you because you're already in your 30s or your 40s and you're not there yet stay tuned because in just a minute I'll explain why millionaire status isn't as Out Of Reach as you may think but first it's time for a little quiz what percentage of millionaires own more than one home is it a 177% b 8% C 26% or D 49% got your answer it's actually B only 8% of millionaires own more than one home that's shocking right surely most millionaires own a vacation home or at least invest in rental properties in real estate right wrong when it comes to millionaires only 11% of their net worth is tied up in real estate in fact millionaires have more of their net worth in cash than they do in real estate and that might start to make a little more sense when we talk about the kind of houses millionaires live in and where they live to begin with because most millionaires don't live in a big house the average size house for millionaires is 2600 ft not a small house by any means but hardly anything that would scream I'm a millionaire as you drove past it the typical millionaire also lives in a neighborhood where they have 4 to five times more wealth than the person next door that's because the price of the house you buy is highly correlated to how much you spend on pretty much everything else mostly due to your mortgage your taxes your property insurances utility bills everything that goes into owning and maintaining a house plus regardless of where you live you tend to act and spend money like your neighbors do do so if you live in an expensive house in an expensive neighborhood you're more likely spending more money just because your neighbors do if they all have brand new BMWs in the driveway suddenly the Honda in yours is looking like it needs an upgrade so literally living below their means by living amongst people with lower incomes than them has been a great key to financial success for a lot of millionaires so far in this video we've seen a lot of things that millionaires aren't but what about some things that millionaires are for one millionaires tend to be well educated almost 90% of them have a college degree and nearly half of all millionaires have a master's degree or higher so don't listen to all those influencers trying to tell you that college is a waste of money and a scam because the statistics don't lie another thing that statistics simply don't lie about married couples are far more likely to become millionaires than single people a lot of this is simply because married couples have two incomes and they can share expenses and save an invest money together and we all know kids are really expensive right you got to pay for diapers you got to save for college you got to feed them for 18 years well a study done by Fidelity Investments found that married couples with children were more likely to become millionaires than married couples without children this is because having children can change a couple's Outlook and motivate them or even force them to save more money for their future and it's looking into the future and planning for the long term that really ties millionaires together 80% of all millionaires stock away for their retirement by investing in their employer's 401k plan which is why you hear me stressing the importance of it so much in almost every video I make now let's have another quiz what's the higher number the percentage of millionaires who got there before the age of 40 or the percentage of you watching who are subscribed to my Channel right now only a touch over 3% of you watching this right now are subscribed which means there's a whole lot of you that can hit that subscribe button and help me on my quest to hitting 100,000 subscri subcribers by the end of this year but surprisingly enough that 3% of you who are already subscribed are still a greater percentage than the percentage of millionaires who got there by their 40th birthday because only 1% of millionaires got there by the age of 40 so if you're in your 30s or in your 40s and feeling stressed about the progress you've made so far relax because most millionaires didn't hit that Milestone until after they turned 50 years old but if you really want to know where you stack up in your wealth building Journey click on this video next to see how much money you need to be considered wealthy or be considered middle class in America by your age thanks as always for watching and I'll see you in the next one in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share some Shock in this video I'll share some","A financial analyst's review of millionaire habits debunks common myths, revealing that wealth is primarily built through disciplined financial habits rather than high income, inheritance, or lavish spending. Key insights include:

*   **Frugality is Paramount:** Millionaires are disciplined spenders, with high percentages using grocery lists and coupons, demonstrating a consistent focus on cost control.
*   **Self-Made and Patient:** The vast majority (80%) are self-made, often from humble beginnings, achieving millionaire status typically after age 50, underscoring the importance of patience and consistent, long-term effort.
*   **Net Worth Trumps Income:** A significant portion of millionaires never earned over $100,000 annually, highlighting that effective income management and savings are more critical than high earnings alone.
*   **Strategic Living and Investing:** They actively live below their means, often owning only one modest home despite significant wealth.

#millionaire #stealthwealth #millionaires","Kind: captions Language: en when it comes to becoming a millionaire 90% of people are obsessed with the wrong thing many of us believe that becoming a millionaire is about being able to spend lots of money on a big house fancy cars or a boat but it's not in this video I'll share some shocking statistics about how millionaires spend save and invest that will shatter your preconceived notions about what it means to be a millionaire and why you should really look forward to your 50th birthday becoming a millionaire has been a marker of financial success for longer than any of us have been alive as of this year there are approximately 22 million millionaires in the United States alone naturally any one of us who isn't a millionaire wants to know what it takes to join that club but when most people say I want to be a millionaire what they really mean is I want to spend a million dollars and that's literally the opposite of what it means to become a millionaire as Morgan household so eloquently put it in the psychology of money what's your routine when you go to the grocery store if you're like me you wander around grabbing the things you need and end up buying way too much because you're hungry or you just got tempted by things that looked good well that's not how millionaires shop in fact 85% of millionaires say they use a grocery list and stick to it when they go to the store and 90% say they use coupons not exactly the careless free spending Bunch you may have imagined huh I mean it's one banana Michael what could it cost $10 there's also a stereotype about millionaires they were all born born into money or received a big inheritance from Rich parents or relatives when in reality that couldn't be further from the truth 80% of millionaires have never received any form of inheritance and 80% also grew up in lower class or middle class households but that's got to change as they become adults and become millionaires right if I were to ask you the top professions of millionaires You' probably rattle off a bunch of high-paying jobs like doctor lawyer business owner YouTuber and there are like a large share of millionaires with those high-paying jobs yet onethird of all millionaires have never earned more than $100,000 in a year 44% of all millionaires consider themselves to be middle class which probably makes sense if you consider their judging themselves on the income they're bringing in not necessarily on the entirety of their net worth and if you're sitting there now thinking that becoming a millionaire is Out Of Reach for you because you're already in your 30s or your 40s and you're not there yet stay tuned because in just a minute I'll explain why millionaire status isn't as Out Of Reach as you may think but first it's time for a little quiz what percentage of millionaires own more than one home is it a 177% b 8% C 26% or D 49% got your answer it's actually B only 8% of millionaires own more than one home that's shocking right surely most millionaires own a vacation home or at least invest in rental properties in real estate right wrong when it comes to millionaires only 11% of their net worth is tied up in real estate in fact millionaires have more of their net worth in cash than they do in real estate and that might start to make a little more sense when we talk about the kind of houses millionaires live in and where they live to begin with because most millionaires don't live in a big house the average size house for millionaires is 2600 ft not a small house by any means but hardly anything that would scream I'm a millionaire as you drove past it the typical millionaire also lives in a neighborhood where they have 4 to five times more wealth than the person next door that's because the price of the house you buy is highly correlated to how much you spend on pretty much everything else mostly due to your mortgage your taxes your property insurances utility bills everything that goes into owning and maintaining a house plus regardless of where you live you tend to act and spend money like your neighbors do do so if you live in an expensive house in an expensive neighborhood you're more likely spending more money just because your neighbors do if they all have brand new BMWs in the driveway suddenly the Honda in yours is looking like it needs an upgrade so literally living below their means by living amongst people with lower incomes than them has been a great key to financial success for a lot of millionaires so far in this video we've seen a lot of things that millionaires aren't but what about some things that millionaires are for one millionaires tend to be well educated almost 90% of them have a college degree and nearly half of all millionaires have a master's degree or higher so don't listen to all those influencers trying to tell you that college is a waste of money and a scam because the statistics don't lie another thing that statistics simply don't lie about married couples are far more likely to become millionaires than single people a lot of this is simply because married couples have two incomes and they can share expenses and save an invest money together and we all know kids are really expensive right you got to pay for diapers you got to save for college you got to feed them for 18 years well a study done by Fidelity Investments found that married couples with children were more likely to become millionaires than married couples without children this is because having children can change a couple's Outlook and motivate them or even force them to save more money for their future and it's looking into the future and planning for the long term that really ties millionaires together 80% of all millionaires stock away for their retirement by investing in their employer's 401k plan which is why you hear me stressing the importance of it so much in almost every video I make now let's have another quiz what's the higher number the percentage of millionaires who got there before the age of 40 or the percentage of you watching who are subscribed to my Channel right now only a touch over 3% of you watching this right now are subscribed which means there's a whole lot of you that can hit that subscribe button and help me on my quest to hitting 100,000 subscri subcribers by the end of this year but surprisingly enough that 3% of you who are already subscribed are still a greater percentage than the percentage of millionaires who got there by their 40th birthday because only 1% of millionaires got there by the age of 40 so if you're in your 30s or in your 40s and feeling stressed about the progress you've made so far relax because most millionaires didn't hit that Milestone until after they turned 50 years old but if you really want to know where you stack up in your wealth building Journey click on this video next to see how much money you need to be considered wealthy or be considered middle class in America by your age thanks as always for watching and I'll see you in the next one in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share in this video I'll share some in this video I'll share some Shock in this video I'll share some","A financial analyst's review of millionaire habits debunks common myths, revealing that wealth is primarily built through disciplined financial habits rather than high income, inheritance, or lavish spending. Key insights include:

*   **Frugality is Paramount:** Millionaires are disciplined spenders, with high percentages using grocery lists and coupons, demonstrating a consistent focus on cost control.
*   **Self-Made and Patient:** The vast majority (80%) are self-made, often from humble beginnings, achieving millionaire status typically after age 50, underscoring the importance of patience and consistent, long-term effort.
*   **Net Worth Trumps Income:** A significant portion of millionaires never earned over $100,000 annually, highlighting that effective income management and savings are more critical than high earnings alone.
*   **Strategic Living and Investing:** They actively live below their means, often owning only one modest home despite significant wealth. Furthermore, nearly 90% hold college degrees (with many having advanced degrees), and a substantial 80% leverage employer 401k plans, affirming the value of education and long-term, systematic investing as foundational wealth-building strategies.",Fidelity Investments,0.95,0.0

A janitor and the world's richest man may not seem like they have much in common. But the stories of Ronald Read and Warren Buffett hold the the key building wealth and becoming a millionaire no matter how much money you make.

this scenario you or I never ever would have heard the name Warren Buffett he' just beat another anonymous rich guy living on a golf course in Florida the truth about Warren Buffett is that 99.7% of all the wealth he has ever accumulated has been accumulated after the age of 50 over 90% of his wealth has been accumulated after he turned age 65 the age where most Americans retire and start collecting Social Security Warren Buffett's insane level of wealth has nothing to do with his investing skill Ronald Reed he wasn't an insanely skilled investor either and if we're honest with ourselves neither are you or I Ronald Reed probably never made much more than min minum wage in his entire life yet he accumulated more than $8 million the same way that Warren Buffett accumulated his hundreds of billions you see Ronald Reed was a Buy and Hold investor who invested small amounts of money into Diversified portfolio of Blue Chip stocks that he knew and understood well and he left that money invested in them for a long period of Time Warren Buffett made his millions early but the reason he has hundreds of billions of dollars is because he started investing at age 10 and is still at it in his mid99s you see the secret to unlocking wealth and becoming a millionaire isn't investing skill it's time something as simple as maxing out your Roth IRA for $7,000 per year from the age you start working at 18 until age 60 that alone would help you aass a Fortune of over $2 million but if you're a bit older and haven't started saving for your future or you just feel like you're behind on your investing goals this video here will help get you on track securing your financial future as laen Buffett and Ronald Reed showed us the one truth about investing that will always remain is that the key to Building Wealth through investing is to do it as consistently as you can for as long as you can","The primary driver of significant wealth accumulation, including becoming a millionaire, is identified as **time and consistent investing**, rather than exceptional investment skill.

This insight is powerfully illustrated by contrasting Warren Buffett, a renowned skilled investor, with Ronald Read, a janitor. For Buffett, the video emphasizes that the vast majority (over 99%) of his immense fortune was accumulated after age 50, underscoring that his extraordinary wealth is a testament to the unparalleled power of compounding over an exceptionally long investment horizon, rather than solely his investment acumen. Conversely, Ronald Read, despite his modest earnings and lack of investment expertise, amassed over $8 million by simply and consistently investing small amounts into a diversified portfolio of understandable ""Blue Chip stocks"" and holding them for decades.

The overarching conclusion is that consistent, long-term investment, even with a simple strategy, can lead to substantial wealth.

Reed was a janitor and a gas station attendant in Vermont these two people seemingly couldn't have anything less in common but what if I told you that the stories of these two very different people put the secret of what it takes to become a millionaire and accumulate massive amounts of wealth and is something that can actually be implemented by you yes you Warren Buffett has a net worth of over $120 billion as widely regarded as one of the best investors of all time but the secret to his massive amounts of wealth has nothing to do with how skillful of an investor he is entered Ronald Reed born just 9 years before Warren Buffett but into an entirely different world where Warren Buffett grew up as the son of a US Congressman Ronald Reed grew up poor as the son of a farmer Warren Buffett went to Wharton and later Columbia business school and was mentored by Benjamin Graham an investor so legendary he actually wrote the book book on investing Ronald Reed walked 4 miles to school in back each day in order to become the first member of his family to get a high school education throughout his teenage years Warren Buffett was involved in owning and operating several different kinds of small businesses he owned and operated pinball machines and owned a stake in a 40 Acre Farm by the time he graduated high school by the age of 35 Warren Buffett had full control of Burkshire Hathaway the company he continues to run today nearly 60 years later reyal Reed surf in World War II until he was honorably discharged in 1945 after returning home from the war he worked as a gas station attendant in rur for the next 25 years until he retired for a year and then resumed work part-time as a janitor at a JC Penney for the next 17 years obviously these two had very different upbringings and very different career paths but there is something that ties them together they were both very very wealthy that's right Ronald Reed guess station attendant and janitor was a multi-millionaire when Ronald Reed died in 2014 his friends his neighbors and his family were all shocked to learn that Ronald had accumulated a Fortune of over $8 million during his lifetime good for him you say but what's that got to do with Warren Buffett or with me well it's because Ronald Reed accumulated his wealth the same way that Warren Buffett actually accumulated most of his and the same way you can accumulate wealth for you and your family yes Warren Buffet has been a better investor than you or I will ever be probably for his entire life but consider this alternate reality for Warren imagine that Warren Buffett had led a more traditional life spending his teenage years his early 20s going to school and figuring out exactly what the heck he wanted to do with his life fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life sir let's say in this scenario Warren hits age 30 with roughly the median net worth of a 30-year-old about $40,000 he then discovers that he is an amazingly skilled investor and goes on to achieve the same mindblowing results he has in real life about 22% annually about 3x the S&amp;P 500 average he does this for the next 30 years until he turns age 60 and like most 60-year-olds he decides to retire spend time with his grandkids play a little golf what would his fortune be in this scenario certainly not 12 20 billion try roughly $15.5 million 99.9% less than the fortune he's actually aass he'd still be very very rich and achieved returns that no mortal investor could ever dream of returning over a 30-year time span but I guarantee you in this scenario you or I never ever would have heard the name Warren Buffett he' just beat another anonymous rich guy living on a golf course in Florida the truth about Warren Buffett is that 99.7% of all the wealth he has ever accumulated has been accumulated after the age of 50 over 90% of his wealth has been accumulated after he turned age 65 the age where most Americans retire and start
